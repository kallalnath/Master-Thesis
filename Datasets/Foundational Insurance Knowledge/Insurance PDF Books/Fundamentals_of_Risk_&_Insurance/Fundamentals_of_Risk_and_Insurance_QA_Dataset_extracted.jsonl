{"question": "What is the purpose of establishing an unearned premium reserve in insurance accounting?", "answer": "The purpose is to account for the fact that expenses have already been paid, resulting in a redundancy in the reserve."}
{"question": "How do expenses impact the reported underwriting results of an insurance company?", "answer": "Expenses are included in the computation as they are paid, leading to distortions in reported underwriting results."}
{"question": "What is the assumed loss ratio in the example provided for XYZ Insurance Company?", "answer": "The assumed loss ratio is 50 percent, with expenses incurred being 40 percent of premiums written."}
{"question": "How does the timing of premium earnings affect the reported profit of an insurance company?", "answer": "If premiums earned exceed premiums written, it can understate profit during increasing premium volume, and overstate profit during declining premium volume."}
{"question": "How does the discrepancy in reported profit for XYZ Insurance Company illustrate the impact of accounting methods?", "answer": "The apparent loss of $150,000 is actually an illusion caused by the accounting method of including expenses as they are paid and premiums as they are earned."}

{"question": "How does a surplus treaty work in reinsurance?", "answer": "In a surplus treaty, the reinsurer agrees to accept some amount of insurance on each risk in excess of a specified net retention. The reinsurer's obligation is expressed as a number of 'lines' and there is a designated maximum limit of liability for the reinsurer."}
{"question": "What are the two forms of reinsurance in the field of life insurance?", "answer": "In life insurance, reinsurance may take one of two forms: the term insurance approach and the coinsurance approach. Under the term insurance approach, the direct writer purchases yearly renewable term insurance equal to the difference between the face value of the policy and the reserve."}
{"question": "How does pooling reinsurance work?", "answer": "Pooling reinsurance involves a pooling arrangement where each member assumes a percentage of every risk written by a member of the pool.

{"question": "How does securitization differ from reinsurance as an approach to risk financing?", "answer": "Securitization differs from reinsurance as an approach to risk financing by its direct link to the capital markets, transferring specific portfolios of risk to investors or speculators."}
{"question": "What is the rationale behind securitizing insurable risks according to some members of the insurance industry?", "answer": "The rationale behind securitizing insurable risks according to some members of the insurance industry is the belief that the industry needs additional capital and that securitization can serve as a source of external funding to protect surplus against catastrophe losses."}
{"question": "How does reinsurance help in increasing the surplus of a direct-writing company?", "answer": "Reinsurance helps in increasing the surplus of a direct-writing company by reducing the net drain on surplus, as the unearned premium reserve is reduced when premiums are transferred to the reinsurer."}
{"question": "What potential feature of catastrophe-linked securities makes them appealing to external markets?", "answer": "Catastrophe-linked securities offer the potential for diversification, fluctuating with a different pattern of gains and losses than traditional stocks and bonds, which can be appealing to external markets."}

{"question": "What triggers determine when an issuer recovers under a catastrophe bond?", "answer": "The trigger, which determines when the issuer recovers under the bond, may be a function of the actual losses of the firm issuing the bond, some industry-wide index of losses, the results of a specific model\u2019s estimate of the loss, or a parametric trigger that is a function of the measured intensity of the event (e.g., the magnitude of an earthquake)."}
{"question": "How has catastrophe bond activity evolved over time and why are they becoming increasingly important for insurers and reinsurers?", "answer": "Catastrophe bond activity has tended to increase following catastrophic losses to the insurance industry, with more recent increases after the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005. They are becoming increasingly important for insurers and reinsurers for managing their property catastrophe exposures."}
{"question": "What is basis risk in the context of catastrophe bonds and how is it addressed?", "answer": "Basis risk in catastrophe bonds refers to the risk that the trigger for repayment may not align perfectly with the actual losses experienced by the issuer. This is addressed by using triggers that are less susceptible to manipulation by the insurer, such as industry-wide loss indexes or specific model outcomes, to minimize basis risk."}
{"question": "What is the essential requirement for catastrophe bonds?", "answer": "The essential requirement for catastrophe bonds is the willingness of the speculator to make a side bet with the insurer."}
{"question": "Who typically issues catastrophe bonds?", "answer": "Most catastrophe bonds have been issued by insurance companies or reinsurers."}
{"question": "How are the bond proceeds protected in catastrophe bond transactions?", "answer": "With most catastrophe bonds, the insurer creates a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to issue the bond. The proceeds of the bond are placed in the SPV, which then provides insurance coverage to the insurance company. This way, the bond proceeds are protected from the risk of the insurance company becoming insolvent or using the proceeds for other purposes."}
{"question": "What is the main advantage of catastrophe bonds over traditional reinsurance contracts?", "answer": "Catastrophe bonds eliminate the credit risk inherent in reinsurance contracts, which is the risk that the reinsurer may not pay the claim. Because the bond issuer already has the money, there is no risk that the funds won't be there to pay the issuer when a catastrophe covered by the bond occurs."}
{"question": "Can you provide examples of unique transactions involving catastrophe bonds?", "answer": "In 2005, AXA, a French insurer, issued bonds that would be triggered by a high loss ratio on its French motor insurance policies.

{"question": "What are hedge funds and how have they contributed to the reinsurance industry?", "answer": "Hedge funds are investment funds used by sophisticated investors and institutions. They have become an important source of capital for the reinsurance industry, providing capital via sidecars after large hurricane losses."}
{"question": "How does contingent capital address concerns of insurers in the event of a catastrophe?", "answer": "Contingent capital gives the insurer the right to sell securities at a predetermined price if a catastrophe occurs within a given timeframe. This helps address concerns of potential losses and the need to replenish capital when the insurer's stock price is low."}
{"question": "What is the Carvill Hurricane Index (CHI) and how is it used in determining insurance payments in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)?", "answer": "CHI is based on a combination of the hurricane's wind velocity and size and is used to calculate losses due to hurricanes. In the CCRIF, insurance payments are based on a parametric trigger tied to the CHI at the time the hurricane makes landfall."}
