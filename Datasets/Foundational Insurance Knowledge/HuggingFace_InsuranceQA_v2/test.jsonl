{"input": "Is Health Insurance Elastic Or Inelastic? ", "output": "I believe that health insurance is neither elastic or inelastic . The amount of insurance most people purchase has little to do with the actual cost of the coverage . In most cases the person making the purchase decision is not the individual paying for the coverage . People can pay widely different amounts for the very same level of coverage . When the coverage is purchased through work the person 's employer is making a portion of the premium payments on behalf of the employee . Any remaining contribution is paid for by the employee using pretax payroll deductions . The IRS is then picking up a portion of the tab in the form of a tax subsidy . When individuals purchase coverage through a state exchange they may be eligible for premium and cost sharing subsidies . The subsidies are based upon the household 's income compared to the federal poverty level . "}

{"input": "What Is Spousal Life Insurance? ", "output": "Spousal life insurance is n't a special type of policy . Life insurance on spouses is a fundamental planning matter . In dual income families , it is important for both earners to consider life insurance to protect the income they each depend on as the lost of one or both would likely result in financial hardship . In the event of a stay at home spouse life insurance should be considered as the loss of that spouse may have a financial impact through new expenses such as day care . "}
{"input": "What Is Spousal Life Insurance? ", "output": "The death of a spouse is perhaps the most emotionally traumatic event which humans experience . What would you do if your spouse died unexpectedly ? In over 55 % of married-couple families today , both marriage partners work outside the home at least part time . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Often the financial requirements to run the household substantially exceed the income of either spouse alone . If an untimely death were to occur , the inability to meet financial obligations with the single remaining spouses income might require the hasty sale of assets or , even worse , a bank foreclosure on the family residence . Life insurance is an excellent means of providing money when it is needed in these traumatic moments . Some families are fortunate enough to allow either the mother or father to stay home with small children while the other earns sufficient cash to meet household and living expenses . It is obvious that the loss of a breadwinner would create a financial calamity . Couples should consider the potential cost of replacing the services of the spouse who stays at home to care for the children . Without the deceased spouse , a surviving spouse working outside the home would face new expenditures for child care , either in the home or at a babysitter or day care center as well as someone to take the children to the doctor , dentist , piano lessons , etc. . Perhaps the surviving parent could take time off work to fulfill these obligations , but this time off work would also amount to a financial loss . Most families can help effectively remove this potential financial emergency by acquiring a life insurance policy on each spouse .

This is the same system used by other Federal employees . Members of Congress did not participate in the Social Security system . They were not eligible for social security benefits based upon their pay as Members of Congress . In 1983 Members of Congress and other federal employees , who were first hired after 1983 , were integrated into the Social Security System . Starting in 1984 all Members of Congress started participating in the Social Security System regardless of when they first entered Congress . Only those on the federal payroll prior to 1984 continue to participate in the Civil Service Retirement System . New Members of Congress since 1984 have participated in both Social Security and a new retirement program called the Federal Employees Retirement System . A Member of Congress can decline coverage in this program . Members elected prior to 1984 had the option of remaining on the Civil Service Retirement System or opting for the new Federal Employees Retirement System . The Civil Service Retirement program was not designed to be integrated with Social Security . The contributions and benefits from this program are much higher . When these benefits are combined with Social Security they can become substantial . Members of Congress can be covered under one of four different programs : 1 . Full coverage under Social Security and the old Civil Service Retirement System . 2 . An offset plan which includes both Social Security and the Civil Service Retirement System but the amount contributed to the CSRS is reduced by the amount paid into Social Security . 3 . The Federal Retirement System and Social Security 4 . Social Security alone . The pensions for Members of Congress are financed through a combination of contributions from the Congressman and from the Federal Governmenttheir employer . When they pay Social Security payroll taxes they pay the standard 6.2 % required of other employees . If they remained in the Civil Service Retirement System they pay an additional 7 % of their pay . If they opted for the Federal Retirement System they pay an additional .8 % of their pay . When they retire a Member of Congress can receive benefits in much the same way other federal employees do . They can file for and receive benefits under Social Security and they can apply for benefits under the retirement program they have adopted . The retirement benefit itself is based upon reaching at least age 62 and is a function of years of service and income in the highest three years of covered salary . The benefit generated under the Civil Service Retirement System is much greater than the benefit under the Federal Retirement System . By law , the benefit paid to a Member of Congress can not exceed eighty percent of the final pay of the Member of Congress . There are around 500 Members of Congress drawing pensions today . Their average pension in 2006 was under $ 35,000 . Members of Congress who elect an immediate annuity can also maintain the health insurance that they had as federal employees . Members of Congress that elect the FERS program are also eligible for a thrift savings program in which contributions are matched to a certain level . "}

{"input": "Can One Person Have Multiple Life Insurance Policies? ", "output": "A person can own as many Life Insurance policies as they desire if they qualify for the coverage and can pay for them . The biggest problem is that without proper counseling the policy may not fit the need that the person was purchasing the policy for . Many policies are put on the market to meet specific needs and because of the public knowledge a person may buy a policy that they thought meant one type of coverage when in actuality it was completely different coverage . Over my lifetime I have worked with persons who would buy term policies when in their mind they had mixed them up with policies which are paid up early , ie , ten pay life , etc. . I have met more than one individual who through the years had bought 10 year term thinking it was like ten pay life and that it would be paid up in ten years . I want to stress here that buying a Life Insurance policy without understanding all of its reasons for existence is like buying any auto with four wheels without knowing anything further . I would also like to point out that most Life Insurance policies have what is called a `` policy fee '' that is attached to the premium of the policy . What this means is that the company is charging fifty to sixty dollars per year for the administration of that policy and there is no coverage on that amount of the premium . I have had people want several smaller policies to avoid taking a medical . This also can be a mistake since most companies have discounts on the larger amounts of Life Insurance on an individual .

{"input": "Can One Person Have Multiple Life Insurance Policies? ", "output": "Yes , with a proviso . You can have multiple life insurance policies , but only up to the face value combined limit of what would be reasonable , based on your income and situation . For example , if you earn $ 50,000 a year , and want a $ 5 million policy combined limit -LRB- say 5 policies of 1 million each -RRB- , that would not be permitted . The reason is that it would be too tempting for someone to due this , then wait two years , and commit suicide , to provide large amounts of money to their family . That is not the purpose of life insurance . It is meant to REPLACE lost income . Not to be a lottery . So , within reason , you could say buy five or perhaps even ten times your annual income . But do not expect to buy one hundred times it , in combined policies . And realize that by splitting up the policies , you gain nothing , since all policies will be viewable to all companies from a national listing they review . Thank you and love to help .

{"input": "Can One Person Have Multiple Life Insurance Policies? ", "output": "The answer here is a resounding YES ! When you go through the process of examining your situation and determining how much life insurance you need , many people can not , or are n't willing to , pay for it all . In these cases , I recommend assigning a priority to each risk , and covering the most important first . As you can afford it , you can purchase additional policies at later dates . Timing is also a factor . Some risks are temporary while others are permanent . For example , a mortgage or college education for your children have an expiration date while your income or living expenses do not . For many of my clients , we will buy term insurance to cover the temporary risks and permanent insurance to cover the permanent risks . Insurance companies , for the most part , are n't concerned with how many different policies you have , they 're concerned about the total amount of coverage you have among all the policies . If money was not an issue I would recommend all permanent insurance as it 's the least expensive in the long run . However , many people can not afford to do this and end up purchasing both permanent and term insurance as their budget allows . The most important thing is to purchase the right amount first , even if it 's all term insurance . Once you lock in your insurability you can always convert that term to permanent as your budget allows . As always , find an advisor you can trust and listen to their advice . We deal with this every day and have specialists at our home offices for more complicated issues . We can usually find the right coverage at a price you can afford . "}

'' When we use the word in our financial word , we are referring to an investment vehicle designed for providing a long lasting income stream . They are offered by insurance companies and other financial institutions , and are used to fund retirements , grants and trusts . Here 's a very simple description of how an annuity works : They are funded by a deposit , which then sits for a number of years gathering interest . After that period of time , the annuity begins paying out a set amount until either it runs out , the owner dies , or the owners spouse dies , depending upon how the annuity is structured . It guarantees that there will be an income that lasts as long as you do . Because they require that the deposit sit untouched for many years , an annuity may not be a good investment for some people . That deposit money can be taken out , but there are very costly penalties . As a result , regulations require that the seller sit down with you first and do what is called a `` suitability study . '' They will go over your financial situation , your retirement plans , and your goals . If it is found to not be `` suitable '' for you , they can not sell you one .

{"input": "Does Divorce Affect Life Insurance? ", "output": "Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and the owner . The subject of the insurance , the insured , may be someone other than the owner . The owner is the person with the power to change the beneficiary . In a divorce settlement care should be taken to identify the owner of the insurance . Existing insurance is difficult to handle in a divorce settlement . When alimony and/or child support is involved it is often better to have the recipient of those payments purchase and own a policy of life insurance on the party paying the alimony or child support . By doing that all of the control over the policy is in the hands of the recipient , to include the power to change the beneficiary . The other major area of concern involving divorce and life insurance is company sponsored life insurance . Often this is overlooked and the intentions of the court and the desires of the beneficiary thwarted if ownership remains in the hands of the other party . The employee can merely call the HR department and changes the beneficiary to someone else . "}
{"input": "Does Divorce Affect Life Insurance? ", "output": "Divorce does affect life insurance but maybe not in the way you are asking your question .

You may not want your ex to receive your life insurance proceeds . Next aspect to be examined is your face amount . Now that you are on your own , do you have the proper amount of life insurance for children , loved ones to cover debt , etc. ? Last is the term or type of policy .

Sometimes you had a policy with your spouse where either you or your spouse were a secondary insured on their policy . You usually wo n't want to leave it that way . If you were the main insured , you are paying the extra premium to cover the rider of your ex-spouse . You might want to leave it if you are the beneficiary but you want to be aware of it and be aware of your options . If you are the rider on your ex-Spouse 's policy you have a bigger problem . You should take out new coverage on your own . Do not trust that your Spouse 's policy will always be there to cover you . There are a lot of variables here .

{"input": "Does Divorce Affect Life Insurance? ", "output": "New York and some other states are known as `` divorce revocation states . '' There is a provision in the N.Y. Estates Powers and Trusts code that automatically revokes an ex-spouse as beneficiary of a life insurance policy . Under certain circumstances this little known provision can wreak havoc on the lives of a surviving parent and children when an ex-spouse dies . The law states that your spouse is automatically revoked as beneficiary of any life insurance policy as soon as you are divorced , even if you do n't want them to be . There is a way this can be addressed , but it requires that the policyholder take action . Let 's assume your husband has a $ 500,000 life insurance policy and you are the beneficiary . You are getting divorced and you both agree that you will work together on any issues involving your children . Your marriage is bad , but you still work together as parents . Your husband says that he will leave you as beneficiary of his life insurance policy until the kids are self supporting . If he just `` leaves '' you as the beneficiary , you will no longer be the beneficiary as soon as you divorce . The state of New York has determined that by the act of the divorce itself you are no longer legally his beneficiary . If he dies without having taken any action , the contingent beneficiary will get the proceeds , not you . In order to fix this , your now ex-husband needs to complete a beneficiary change form and make you the beneficiary again , this time listing your relationship as `` ex-spouse . '' It 's a small technicality but not addressing it could be financially catastrophic . By naming you as his beneficiary and ex-spouse after the divorce , you are now legally the beneficiary again . I saw one case where the wife `` took over '' her ex-husbands life insurance policy to make sure the policy stayed in effect and she remained the beneficiary . She had been paying the premium for many years when her ex-husband passed away . When she filed the death claim she was told that because the beneficiary designation predated the divorce she had been revoked as beneficiary . The benefit was paid to someone else . If you are divorced and you or your ex-spouse 's life insurance predates the divorce , it 's critical that you find out if yours is a divorce revocation state . If it is , update your beneficiaries . I apologize for the very long post , but there are many women -LRB- and men too ! -RRB- that need to be aware of this . "}
{"input": "Does Divorce Affect Life Insurance? ", "output": "+1 Larry 's answer . I will add that cash values in Life Insurance can also play a role . They can be considered an asset and the owner of the policy could be made to buy the other party out . Note the owner and the insured may not be the same person . On that note , a decree could also dictate who will be the owner of a policy going forward . Example : If I and my wife own policies on each other . "}
{"input": "Does Divorce Affect Life Insurance? ", "output": "Maybe better put as can Life insurance be effected by a divorce ? The answer is `` yes '' . The court can degree as part of the settlement that life insurance is maintained and beneficiary be illrevocable for a certain number of years . For example , say children are involved and support is required . The court could mandate that life insurance is carried for a certain number of years and that a trust for the children 's benefit be created upon death to continue support payments . So a life policy could be effected by divorce through legal process . One thing to consider as well is if no requirements are set by the courts , the last stated beneficiary would be the one to receive life insurance proceeds . So failure to change the beneficiary would result in a pay out to someone the insured no longer intended the proceeds to go to . A change of beneficiary form is easy to get and easy to use and becomes part of the policy once submitted to the insurance carrier . You can contact your agent or even the company directly for this form . "}
{"input": "How To Choose A Homeowners Insurance? ", "output": "That is a great question ! The best way to choose a policy is to do two things : Your homework , and the legwork .

Have a good idea what the value of your things are - have serial numbers , models and makes , even pictures of things to establish value . Get comparable prices .

{"input": "How Much Does Health Insurance Go Up Each Year? ", "output": "Prior to 2014 it was reasonable to anticipate annual increases in group and individual health insurance in the high single digits to low teen 's range . Though , of course , these are just generalized averages and a host of other factors could move rates higher or , in rarer instances , lower . We have already seen the base cost of health insurance increase fairly substantially in 2014 due to the implementation of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- . The effect was especially pronounced in the individual health insurance market of almost every state due to the mandatory addition of new benefits , the move to the community rating approach , the elimination of underwriting and adjusting rates for risk , and making all policies guaranteed to be issued without pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions . In mid-2014 we are just now beginning to receive health insurance companies filings for their proposed 2015 rates . While the rate filings vary from state to state and from insurance carrier to insurance carrier , individual health insurance rate increases in the teens to 25 % or more are being reported in many areas across the nation . In some limited instances though , you are seeing some filings requesting rate reductions but these are pretty rare . Therefore , most people should be prepared to see their rates for individual health insurance increase meaningfully again in 2015 , though this effect may be hidden to some extent for those persons who qualify for premium tax subsidies through the government health insurance marketplaces . Many small business groups are also seeing substantial rate increases in their renewal actions for the 2014-2015 benefit year . Increases of 20 % to 40 % are not uncommon . "}
{"input": "How Much Does Health Insurance Go Up Each Year? ", "output": "The increase in premium on a health insurance plan will be different for everyone because we each have different insurance companies we use , different plans -LRB- catastrophic , bronze , silver , gold , and platinum level plans -RRB- , live in different areas , etc. . Factors such as claims history from the prior year , the service area , the cost of care in a given area , and many others go into the rate increase determination by each carrier . There 's no specific percentage or dollar amount that a plan will always go up by . For example , a carrier may have a 2 % increase one year , no increase the next year , and a 6 % increase the year after that .

{"input": "How Does Cancer Insurance Work? ", "output": "Cancer insurance is used to help pay for non-covered and out of pocket items under your major medical plan . These things will include your deductibles and copay , as well as some treatment disallowed under major medical . Some cancer plans are reimbursement policies while others pay a lump sum cash benefit on first diagnosis . "}
{"input": "Things To Look At When Buying Health Insurance? ", "output": "Excellent question ! You essentially have 3 main variations on the theme when purchasing ObamaCare compliant major medical insurance ; 1 -RRB- Conventional plan designs with office visit & prescription copays and lower deductibles -LRB- pretty pricey these days -RRB- 2 -RRB- High deductible health insurance plans designed to work with a Health Savings Account -LRB- HSA -RRB- or a Health Reimbursement Arrangement -LRB- HRA -RRB- - becoming more common . 3 -RRB- Plans that fall in between , here you may see a plan with office visit copays and a high deductible applying to everything else , plans with prescription copays and a high deductible applying to everything else , or plans with more moderate deductible levels with all services subject to the plan 's deductible and co-insurance requirements but that also do n't meet the IRS requirements for being an HSA eligible plan . Simple , right ? First , determine if the doctors , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use are in-network providers for the plan you are interested in . Second , review you health and your history of health care consumption . Your needs and usage at 27 will probably be much different than when you are 47 . Try to pick a plan that you believe will meet your needs in the coming year at the best value . Determine if the plan you are interested in allows for direct access to specialists or whether it requires you to be referred out by your primary care physician first . Neither approach is bad but you should understand how you are supposed to access care in order to maximize your benefits and minimize your costs . Ask what your coverage is when you are outside of your immediate area . Increasingly you may find that you only have emergency care outside of a plan 's `` service area '' or perhaps no coverage at all . Do you have special needs ? A chronic illness or injury that requires ongoing treatment or expensive prescription medication requires extra homework . For example , some health plan 's pharmacy benefits cover HIV/AIDS medications at the lowest level -LRB- to them , highest for you -RRB- possible . Finally , compare monthly premiums . The lowest monthly cost , while always attractive , many not really be the lowest annual cost for you once you factor in some or all of the issues I have pointed out above . It may be worth another $ 50 a month in premiums to have a prescription copay instead of a deductible of up to $ 6300 to meet before your expensive medication is covered . "}

The first three should be explored for tax advantaged , supplemental retirement income scenarios and the last one for permanent coverage to indemnify your beneficiaries . "}
{"input": "Why Do I Need Universal Life Insurance? ", "output": "Universal Life is a unique product . The advantages of a Universal Life Policy are : Flexible Premiums , you can put more into the policy to act as a savings and enhance cash accumulation . You can skip payments as long as there is enough in the cash value to continue the insurance . You can decrease the face amount or increase the face amount -LRB- as long as your health qualifies -RRB- . It has a competitive interest rate . It is a good way to get a lot of insurance for a lower premium than whole Life . The disadvantages : It must be funded properly . Because you can skip or put less into the policy than the Target Premium , the policy could lose its death benefit . Picture a bucket of money . The bucket has a hole in it and it is dripping . If the water -LRB- money -RRB- going into the bucket is greater than the water going out of the bucket , you are OK . But if you do not have enough going into the bucket and it is draining faster than being filled , then the water will eventually run out . When that happens the insurance will cease . Universal Life is a good product , but not for everyone . "}
{"input": "Why Do I Need Universal Life Insurance? ", "output": "Simply put , term life insurance , whole-life life insurance , universal life insurance and annuities etc. are very important things to think about to protect your financial future . Generally , speaking the best time to think about these products is when you are talking to a licensed insurance agent and you can think them over together . All of these products , or a combination of these products , may suit your individual needs . I work for a few companies that offer high-cash value products that can be used for various business ventures or personal wealth-building opportunities , if set up properly . Therefore , when considering any of these insurance products it is usually best to meet with an agent so they can help you figure out which products you need , can afford and find out if you qualify for them . "}
{"input": "Why Do I Need Universal Life Insurance? ", "output": "Why do I need a universal life insurance policy ? Usually because you want a stable premium and can not afford a true whole life product to insure yourself . You are looking for a longer period of time to be covered than a term policy can offer . I would hope that if a person chooses UL , that they choose guaranteed universal life as that guarantee makes a UL a more stable product . "}

{"input": "Does Life Insurance Know If You Smoke? ", "output": "When you apply for life insurance , the insurance company will ask about smoking on the application . If you take a No Exam policy , they will ask you about smoking in the phone interview .

If medical records are ordered and a history of smoking is noted in your medical records , they will take that into consideration , as well . "}
{"input": "Does Life Insurance Know If You Smoke? ", "output": "It depends , who else knows that you smoke ? Does your doctor ? Does your health insurance plan ? Auto Insurance ? If there is a written record of you smoking it more than probable that it will be inside the MIB -LRB- Medical information Bureau -RRB- and it will come up during the underwriting phase . There 's the MIB and your doctor 's chart notes that would be reviewed . Also depending on your state where they do n't apply the contestability rules towards smoking . My state for example waives the two year contestability clause specifically for not declaring if a insured is a smoker or not . What that means is premium paid is returned and no contract was created . "}
{"input": "Does Life Insurance Know If You Smoke? ", "output": "The life insurance company will definitely know if you smoke because that is something you disclose to them . To fail to do so would amount to insurance fraud which is subject to fines and possible imprisonment . When applying for life insurance you want to get the best rate that you actually qualify for . Do not get a policy by withholding or falseifing information . You will not often come out ahead . If you have an agent ever tell you to sign an application that has known wrong information , you should report the agent to your state 's department of insurance . He is putting your financial security at risk by trying to make a quick and easy sale . "}
{"input": "Does Life Insurance Know If You Smoke? ", "output": "If you begin smoking after the policy is issued then the answer is no . Most companies have a question on the application regarding smoking and depending on the policy you are purchasing they may require a blood urine or saliva test and will check for smoking before issuing a policy . If you lie an an application and you die within two years and the company finds out then your policy will not pay the death benefit . This is considered insurance fraud . "}
{"input": "How To Get Health Insurance As A College Student? ", "output": "First , check with your college 's office of student affairs or administration and see if they have a student health insurance plan . Due to the requirements of ObamaCare many of these plans have been cancelled or are being phased out but some do still exist . Next , you can be covered as a dependent on your parent 's health insurance policy until age 26 so if you have recently lost or will be losing coverage when you start school you could possibly be added onto their plan . Regarding true major medical individual health insurance you are pretty well locked out until the next open enrollment period starting on November 15th and the earliest you could be covered would be January 1 , 2015 . This is unless you have what is called a change of life status event -LRB- marriage , divorce , child birth or adoption , losing other coverage -RRB- in which case you have a 60-day time frame to apply for individual health insurance coverage . If you are in good health and coverage for any pre-existing health conditions is not a major concern for you then the best solution for immediate coverage would be to apply for a short term medical insurance policy . These policies are pretty affordable and depending upon the insurance carrier they may issue a policy that runs for a period just short of one year and you can often reapply for coverage . If you reside in Tennessee , Arkansas or Mississippi contact me and I 'll be happy to help you out with this . If you reside in another state seek out a health insurance broker or go online and do a search for Short Term Medical . Assurant Health and United Healthcare/Golden Rule have pretty good short term policies and , of course , you would want to check with the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan in your state .

{"input": "Why Should I Open A Roth IRA? ", "output": "Any step made to accumulate money for retirement is a step in the right direction . The money accumulated in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn after 5 years income tax free and without the additional 10 % penalty tax if you are over 59.5 years old , have become disabled or are using the money for a first time home purchase . Additional advantages of a Roth IRA are that there will not be a minimum distribution required when you reach age 70.5 , and there are superior estate tax opportunities . "}
{"input": "Why Should I Open A Roth IRA? ", "output": "That is a great question ! There are several reasons why opening a Roth makes sense . The first is that the minimum distribution and withdrawal requirements are much less strict than in traditional IRA 's , and can have beneficiaries to receive the balances when you pass . This type of IRA will allow you to take money out without penalties under the right circumstances where a traditional IRA wo n't . They are also great to have because they are not taxable income when you do start taking cash from them . The funding for your Roth is done after-tax , and the earnings are also tax favored , making this a great investment vehicle . I hope that helps , thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "Does My Small Business Have To Offer Health Insurance? ", "output": "No . The employer mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- apply to employers with 50 or more full-time/full-time equivalent employees . So , if your company has 20 full time employees and 6 part-time employees that probably translates into the equivalent of 23 full time employees and places you well below the threshold where you have to provide employee health insurance or be subject to the employer mandate tax penalty . If you need to attract and retain quality employees and reduce turnover then it may well be in your self interest as a small business to offer group health insurance to your employees . However , with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act 's health insurance marketplaces and premium tax subsidies to help persons between 100 % and 400 % of the Federal Poverty Level purchase individual health insurance the small business owner 's decision in this regard is more complicated now . If your workforce is largely lower income and you are asking or would be asking your employees to pay a significant portion of the cost of group health insurance it is possible you are actually doing your employees and their dependents a disservice by providing group health insurance as this effectively blocks them from purchasing subsidized individual health insurance in the government health insurance marketplaces . There is some analysis required and business philosophy decisions to be made by the small business owner in making the decision as to whether offering group health insurance is the best course of action in todays environment . You should seek out the services of an experienced health insurance broker who is well educated on the Affordable Care Act to help you make this decision . I am a 30 year industry veteran and Chartered Benefit Consultant , if I can be of assistance to you in this matter please feel free to contact me . "}

Supplementing your Original Medicare coverage -LRB- Medicare Parts A & B -RRB- with a Medicare Supplement plan will help you create a very predictable expense structure for your healthcare and allow you to see any doctor you want that accepts Medicare .

The 10 different plans available are plans A , B , C , D , F , G , K , L , M , and N -LRB- a high-deductible plan F is also available that features a $ 2,140 deductible in 2014 - the trade-off being a substantially reduced premium -RRB- . Each plan offers certain benefits some more comprehensive than others . Each plan must cover a core set of benefits -LRB- also known as the basic benefits -RRB- . The basic benefits are : 1 -RRB- Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits are used up . 2 -RRB- Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3 -RRB- First 3 pints of blood 4 -RRB- Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment There 's a total of 9 benefits that can be secured .

If cost is not a major factor for you , Plan F will be the recommended choice because it covers all 9 benefits at 100 % - it 's the most popular plan by far . If you 're looking to keep your costs down , but still have very comprehensive coverage , you may want to look at plans C , G , and N as well .

If that is an issue , sometimes the insurer will be willing to prorate the back owed amount over the new premium , until it is repaid .

{"input": "What Drugs Do Health Insurance Companies Test For? ", "output": "I am presuming that you are asking about tests for illegal drug consumption and not just prescription medications in general . As far as health insurance goes this is a non-issue . An applicant for health insurance is not subjected to any physical exams or blood or urine tests as a condition for being offered health insurance coverage . While in the past there may have been questions regarding illegal drug usage on a health insurance application that if answered truthfully by a drug user could have resulted in their being declined for coverage in the individual health insurance market we have moved past that now . As the Affordable Care Act prohibits medical underwriting and requires policies to be guaranteed to be issued regardless of pre-existing conditions there are no such questions to be answered now . Ironically , in the individual health insurance marketplace the only drug that you can be asked about and perhaps penalized for in the form of higher premiums is for tobacco use . No questions are asked about marijuana , cocaine or other drugs . This is different from applying for life insurance where in many cases a physical exam that may include drawing blood and/or taking a urine sample are part of the underwriting process . With the expanded number of states that have approved marijuana for medical usage and the outright legalization that Colorado and Washington are now experimenting with the life insurance industry is having to adjust to this changing legal environment in their underwriting practices . Different life insurance carriers are addressing the marijuana usage issue in different ways so there is no universal standard being applied to this issue and it is an area where a great deal of evolution is currently underway and probably will be for years to come .

{"input": "What Drugs Do Health Insurance Companies Test For?

{"input": "How To Contest A Life Insurance Beneficiary? ", "output": "Get a lawyer , because odds are you will need a court order to force the change . The job of the life insurance company is to honor the contract with the policy owner . The policy owner has control and so gets to designate the beneficiary . At the time of application , the company makes sure the beneficiary has insurable interest . Is he or she a family member ? Business partner ? Charitable recipient ? People with a financial dependence on the insured qualify as beneficiaries . In addition , the processes of prequalification and underwriting are pretty effective in confirming the insured and policy owners are in the right frame of mind to make major financial decisions . No company wants to enter into a legal agreement with another party who is not competent . So these life insurance contracts could be considered pretty solid . Nonetheless , is it possible that there was some kind of extraneous pressure or personal problem that resulted in a bad decision by the policyholder ? Sure . You would have to prove that . And that , of course , it would take time and money . I think pretty valid challenges could conceivably be made . Divorce , remarriage , adoption . Birth of a child . Death of a spouse . All these events could show that one family member was more dependent on the insured than the other . And entitled to the insurance benefit . Perhaps the policyholder was indeed ill , or under severe life stress . Doctors may have to be called upon . Therapists ? Business associates ? I think you can get an idea of just how much work you would have to put into contesting the beneficiary designation on the policy . Make sure it is worth it . "}
{"input": "How To Contest A Life Insurance Beneficiary? ", "output": "To contest a life insurance beneficiary , you must hire legal representation and prepare to be in for a long haul . It is unusual that the court will side with the one contesting the beneficiary . However , if you can prove that a major life event occurred and that the policy owner neglected to make the beneficiary change , sometimes the challenge will work . Some are able to use arbitration to settle such disputes . It is easier to contest a beneficiary if the beneficiary has not financial interest with the policy owner . "}

{"input": "Does Health Insurance Actually Make People Healthier? ", "output": "Health insurance itself does not make anyone healthier or sicker . Removing or reducing the financial barriers to accessing healthcare that health insurance makes possible helps create an environment where preventive care is encouraged and health problems may be detected at earlier more manageable stages . Past statistics showed a correlation between having health insurance and better health . However , those statistics come from the era when underwriting of health insurance for risk was allowed and individuals could be declined for coverage for pre-existing conditions . Starting in 2014 such practices are no longer allowed in the fully insured health insurance marketplaces and so a totally different risk pool is being created and we are essentially working on the assumption that expanding access to care will correlate with improved health care outcomes . As health care reform is easing access for some segments of our population that may have been on the outside looking in in the past , it is also raising premium costs and out-of-pocket expenses to levels that are either forcing some previously insured persons out of insurance coverage or significantly raising the out-of-pocket expenses they must incur before their coverage kicks in which may deter some people from seeking needed treatment . For this reason the jury will be out for some time as to whether our current health insurance reform efforts will yield improved health for the general population . A person can have the best health insurance possible but if the individual does not take responsibility for managing their health -LRB- smoking cessation , weight management , exercise , etc. -RRB- their overall health status is unlikely to improve .

{"input": "Does Renters Insurance Cover Hurricanes ", "output": "A renters policy provides coverage for damage that is the result of a covered peril . Since there is a wide variety of forms this can not be answered for every case , however , most policies list windstorm or hail right after fire and lightning . These are the fundamental coverages contained in most policies . The coverage has some limitations . The company will normally not pay for loss to property inside a structure , caused by dust , rain , sand , sleet , snow or water , all whether driven by wind or not , which enter through an opening not made by the direct force of wind or hail . The company is not likely to pay for the loss to watercraft and their trailers unless inside a fully enclosed building . Smaller water craft normally have coverage . If your property damage is subject to ordinance or law , such as a connection for an appliance , there might be a limitation on the increased cost of replacement that comes because of that law or ordinance . If the hurricane causes landslides or erosion , damage to your personal property arising from that movement of land might not be covered either . The same is true if the damage comes from flood water or tidal waves . This exclusion applies whether it is caused by wind or not . If the hurricane interrupts power supply the insurance company probably will deny coverage on any loss that result from that cause , for example rotting food in a freezer . If you are running a business out of your apartment , the company will probably exclude any loss that comes from that business to include interruption because there isnt power or people can not reach your apartment . The chances are quite good that if a hurricane strikes your apartment , that your renters policy will replace your property up to the limits of the policy . This is when you find out how good your coverage is . If you have appropriate limits you could be fully restored , minus the deductible . It is very important to have the correct limits for coverage on your renters policy . To make sure that you have adequate coverage take a picture of everything that you own inside your apartment . Then make a chart showing the property and the estimated cost of replacing the property . When you add up that list you will have the amount of coverage you should set as a limit for your policy . The pictures and estimates should be stored off-site in case that hurricane becomes a reality . Hurricanes often result in a loss of life . While that might seem remote , this might be a good time to consider what will happen to those that you leave behind . A quick inventory of debts would be a good thing to have handy . If you can eliminate debts and pay for final expenses you would be a great help to those that you love . Every weekend we see people on street corners seeking donations or offering car wash services so they can pay the expenses for a loved one . It is sad but it can be avoided with just a small amount of planning . "}

When people say `` Full Coverage '' they 're usually referring to a combination of Liability , Collision , Comprehensive and a few other overages . "}
{"input": "How Much For Full Coverage Car Insurance? ", "output": "As I illustrated recently to a class of high school freshmen , that is really a complicated question but let me clarify full-coverage first . Insurance agents only use that term when someone else introduces the subject . We know that full-coverage does not mean that the insurance company will make everything right all the time . Policies have limits , claims are adjusted and there are a great many places where there could be misunderstandings . An insurance policy has two major sections , liability and property damage . Many people think that if they have coverage in both sections they have full-coverage . If they cause an accident and people are injured , they might well be sued . The liability portion of the policy will stand between them and the injured party until the judgments and expenses exceed the liability limits written in their policy . These limits can range from $ 15,000 to over $ 1 million . So if someone is injured and sues and wins a judgment in the amount of $ 50,000 , your full-coverage policy might not meet your needs and the court might be looking at your other assets to satisfy the judgment . A similar disagreement can arise with property damage . This is settled on actual cash value , unless you have a rare policy with agreed value coverage . There are two problems which present themselves . You might really love your little Ford Focus that you bought two years ago and when it is damaged disagree with the adjuster on the value of the car . When the car is inspected the adjuster may decide that the car can not be repaired economically . The adjusted value presented will probably be less than you expected because there is a deductible which will be taken out of the settlement . Again , your full-coverage policy may not cover you in the way that you want . However , you asked about cost and in California the cost is dependent on the year , make and model of the vehicle , where the vehicle is registered , the driving record of the members of the household , the annual mileage of the vehicle , and then the coverages that you select . Companies offer discounts and sometimes assess penalties based on driving histories , other types of coverage , the occupation of the principal operator and other factors . The answer to how much it costs is , it depends . "}

{"input": "What Kind Of Annuities Are Out There? ", "output": "There are many different kinds of annuities offered by many different insurance companies . Each annuity has its own features .

The payment is guaranteed for a period of time or for a lifetime -LRB- or lifetimes in the case of a joint payout -RRB- . Variable Annuities : This annuity has tax deferred growth that is based on the performance of the sub-accounts within the contract . The owner of the annuity can choose which accounts to allocate their funds . The performance of the annuity can be either positive or negative so an owner is assuming some level of investment risk . Fixed Annuity : This annuity has tax deferred growth that is set for a fixed period of time . The interest rate of the annuity is usually set at the purchase date but can be adjusted at a later date in some contracts . The performance is usually a known outcome and highly dependent on the length of the annuity contract . Indexed Annuities : This annuity has tax deferred growth that is based on the performance of an particular index -LRB- es -RRB- . The owner can choose which index -LRB- es -RRB- to allocate their funds such as the S&P , but their funds are n't actually invested in that index . The index is only used to determine the performance . The performance of indexed annuities are usually only zero or higher with a limit on the upside known as a `` cap .

When someone without insurance seeks medical care , the cost for that treatment is passed on to all the other people who seek treatment in the form of higher prices . Insuring them returns that cost to them , and the insurance company . Also adding more healthy people to the pool lowers costs , as there is more money going in , and less going out , lowering costs . I hope that helps , thanks for asking ! "}

{"input": "How do I know what conditions are covered on a critical illness plan? ", "output": "I am a huge fan of Critical Illness plans -LRB- CI -RRB- . So I 'm happy to add to the great comments above . What is covered is always defined ... . yet there are a few `` twists to look for '' . Most CI plans have moved to a `` multiple bucket '' philosophy . Most cover the `` Big Three '' critical illnesses : Cancer , Heart Attack , & Stroke . What you have to understand is if the policy is a `` One and Done '' or a `` Multiple Bucket '' plan . One and Done means that once the benefit is paid out for one CI , then the policy terminates . Diagnosed with cancer , you get the check , but there is no benefit for hart attack or stroke . A multiple bucket policy usually has a benefit for different categories -LRB- buckets of money -RRB- : Heart/Stroke , Cancer , Other . So you could be diagnosed with cancer & a benefit is paid . Then the stress gives you a heart attack & a benefit is paid . Then after all that , some `` other CI '' happens and you get a 3rd benefit . ALSO consider what the definitions are WHEN a benefit is paid . Consider an Organ Transplant benefit . Does it pay upon diagnosis and being added to the national registry or does it pay when the physical transplant is completed ? That 's a biiiiig timing difference . Also consider the `` Carcinoma in Situ '' definition and benefit amount . That 's when cancer is isolated to one tissue type -LRB- general definition -RRB- . Being smaller & localized , a Carcinoma in Situ is generally `` not as dangerous or life threatening '' . I believe all CI plans with a Carcinoma in Situ benefit pays only a percentage of the full benefit . So if you have a $ 10,000 cancer bucket , yet it 's Carcinoma in Situ , do you get 10 or 25 % of the full benefit ? Hmmmmm . OR ... does the CI plan your agent is offering even have an in Situ ??? Most have in Situ benefits . Just double check . If you trigger the in Situ benefit know that you still have the remaining percentage left in case the cancer spreads . Usually called invasive cancer . If you received $ 2500 out of your $ 10,000 when it was in Situ , you still have $ 7500 in your `` bucket '' in case things get worse . Look at the riders -LRB- additional benefits too -RRB- . Return of premium upon death -LRB- other than a named CI -RRB- or return of premium after a named period of time , Mortgage payment , accident benefits , hospital benefits , and children 's benefits are riders offered by various carriers . Weigh the cost vs. the benefit based on YOUR specific needs . PLEASE consider coverage for your children . I know that if one of my girls was living in a children 's hospital fighting cancer , I 'd also live there . The cash injection can be financially life saving . HOPE all this helped ... - gravy "}
{"input": "How do I know what conditions are covered on a critical illness plan?

Depending upon the company and the policy it markets there may be other conditions it covers or there may be situations where certain conditions will trigger only a partial payment of the policy 's face amount .

{"input": "How Should I Buy Life Insurance? ", "output": "The first step in buying life insurance is to determine how much coverage you need , what type of insurance will work best for your needs , and how much it will cost . With life insurance you can not just pick out the policy with the features that you like . You must qualify medically , and your overall mortality risk -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- determines your rate . What company you use and the type of policy you choose also figure into the premium you will pay . So the best way to buy life insurance is to talk to an agent who can help you determine how much you need , explain what types of policies work best for that need , and then shop around to find the best rate for which you qualify . Good life insurance agencies stick with you and guide you through to the time when the policy you want is in your safe , ready to go into action if tragedy strikes . While a life insurance agent is the last person most people wish to consult , in the end , most policies require an agent as the middle person , anyway .

If you are prescribed a drug that is associated with addictive behavior that could be a red flag . "}
{"input": "Will I Be Drug Tested For Life Insurance? ", "output": "Only policies that use medical underwriting will test you for drug use through a blood and/or urine test .

However , the minimum age for guaranteed issue life insurance is usually at least 40 years old . If the drug use that you are referring to is marijuana , that generally is not a problem , if you apply with the right companies . Using marijuana after a recent DUI or after treatment for addiction is problematic . And of course , using cocaine , meth or heroin makes it difficult to get all but the most lenient -LRB- and therefore , most expensive -RRB- of life insurance policies . Talk to a life insurance agency that you can trust to find out what type of policy is workable for you , at the lowest possible price .

Their offer would be contingent upon a clean drug test now . If you you still use drugs , then you should consider one of the simplified issue policies referenced above .

But if you 've traded , sold or otherwise allowed someone else into your space on your time , then you may possibly be liable , depending upon the terms of the contract that you signed . If this is a property that you are an owner of for a specific number of years , then the liability issues may be more yours than the true property owners . Again , it will depend entirely on the policy exclusions that were in the contract you signed at purchase . If you own the property , most likely it 's you . My recommendation is to take a look at your contract and see , and if you can not find it , contact the company and have them send you a copy .

{"input": "Am I Liable If Someone Gets Hurt In My Timeshare? ", "output": "Let 's be realistic , your home is where you are at and a reasonably understanding of liability means you can be held responsible for the injuries a guest suffers while in your home . Your responsibility in any event is n't likely to absolve the property management company -LRB- or the property owner -RRB- of liability -LRB- or at least a duty to defend themselves -RRB- because no self-respecting plaintiff 's attorney would let a potential pocket full of money get by him or her in the process of assigning liability . The good news is that if you have home insurance you have some amount of liability insurance to protect for the injuries that someone may suffer as a consequence of your negligence anywhere you are at . That includes the time share you have bought and including the property you have traded for in your time-share relationship . Now , none of the latter should be construed to make you liable for any event , only to clarify that you are indeed responsible for your actions and that includes the space you may be occupying as a temporary residence , whether a time share or a hotel room . How much liability you have depends on plenty of things we could speculate on but the answer above stands for itself . Even if you are found to be free of liability , the cost of defense and getting to that point in time after an event is still costly and your liability coverage includes the benefit of defense against these allegations . Liability is expensive to defend and costly to pay for in the absence of insurance so a basic understanding of the tort of negligence and your duties is all I intend to imply in the latter answer .

It can become a math problem in determining the shortest distance between retiring debt while also accumulating savings for retirement . Generally speaking it is best to reduce the `` bad '' debt which is not tax-deductible and accruing high interest rates . You figure a credit card at 18 % interest is going to yield an immediate 18 % return on your investment by paying it off . However I would think twice before paying off a zero % car loan and instead use the bank 's money to fund your Roth IRA . Also , if you stop contributing to a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan you may be leaving `` free money '' on the table by neglecting the employer match if there is one . Overall , if you have an overwhelming amount of debt , it is best to tackle that first , but once it becomes manageable , to fire up the retirement savings , especially in a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- with an employer match .

{"input": "Should You Save For Retirement Or Pay Off Debt? ", "output": "Should you save for retirement or pay off debt ? My answer is BOTH . While paying off debt is important , waiting till your debt free may not be something you ever get to . It is important to get into the habit of setting aside some money for retirement .

Other forms of debt are not deductible . The interest rate charged on some debt is negligible while the cost of other debt can be onerous . Credit card debt comes to mind when I think of high interest rates . While I appreciate the thoughts about retiring debt before starting a retirement program , I think it would be wise to discuss this with a tax expert . Taxation can play a vital role in this decision because the contributions to a retirement program receive favored tax treatment , where plain ordinary debt doesnt . It seems to me that the key question is the extent to which the debt is exerting pressure on the family . If it is a small amount and being retired in a systematic manner , I think that starting a retirement program at the same time makes good sense . Dont forget that what a retirement program needs is time . Shifting capital into retirement early can be quite helpful . "}
{"input": "Should You Save For Retirement Or Pay Off Debt? ", "output": "When youre looking at the question of what comes first retirement or paying off debt , the answer is paying off debt . But everything really starts with a good self-inventory of your income and expenses and setting up a budget so you can start telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it all went . If you have never made a budget I can send you a free worksheet that outlines the different categories and roughly how much of your income should be going to each . After you have your budget in place your next step is to set up an emergency fund minimum of $ 500 to $ 1000 . Having an emergency fund can take the pressure off of lifes curve balls when they happen and it helps you stay on track with your budget . Then you should start paying down your debt , start with the smallest bills first , once one is paid off add that payment to the next smallest bill . Its like a snowball rolling downhill gaining momentum tackling bill after bill with more force . Your next step is to build your emergency fund up so that it could cover 3 to 6 months of your expenses in case of job loss or medical illness . Once thats in place then you can look at retirement planning . If you have any questions please feel free to call me . "}
{"input": "Should You Save For Retirement Or Pay Off Debt? ", "output": "That is a great question ! There are a couple schools of thought here , both with merit . One school will tell you to pay off debt first , and then contribute the amount that would have been paid to interest and loans to your retirement fund . The other will tell you to start funding your retirement early , so as to best utilize the power of time and compounding interest . I recommend a hybrid approach . If you have the opportunity to fund a workplace 401k with employer match , then contribute as much as you can to receive the employer match . It makes no sense to pass on that free money , and longer time at compounded interest will grow a fund faster than shorter time and larger contributions . If that is n't an option , then open a Roth account , and fund it with automatic deposits of whatever amount you can afford . At the same time , working off a detailed budget , we work at reducing the debt , and creating an emergency savings . The ` snowball ' payment method is one that I 've found to be effective in creating excitement and motivation in reducing debt . I 've found that with most clients finding the money to be able to work on those goals simultaneously is n't hard to do , once we 've scoured their spending habits and expenses . Having automated deposits to pay your savings and Roth are also big key steps - what you do n't see , you do n't miss ! I 'm certain that you will get several differing opinions and answers to your question , so I 'd ask that you really think them over , and work with the answer that feels best to you .

The premiums are very affordable and with the right plan can have a good guaranteed rate of return on investment . The second reason is protect the child 's insurability . If you purchase life insurance on a child most all companies have a conversion clause which means the child can convert to higher face amounts , five , ten or greater times the original death benefit without proof of insurability .

In variable life policies , the cost of the insurance is paid , or not paid , by the performance of the stock market . Instead of the safety of a steady , known payment , a variable policy is tied to the stock market , and as it varies , so does the policy 's value , length of coverage , and your premium payment amount .

{"input": "How Many People Go Without Health Insurance? ", "output": "I think the real answer to your question is that no one knows for sure . Prior to the conclusion of the recent open enrollment period estimates ranged from somewhere in the 30 million to as high as 48 million Americans being uninsured . Certainly the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- has made some dent in this number but firm figures are difficult to obtain at this time -LRB- late April 2014 -RRB- and even the figures reported are subject to debate . If the goal of the Affordable Care Act was to eliminate Americans being uninsuredthen even the most optimistic enrollment figures of 10 million -LRB- when you include Medicaid expansion and young persons being able to stay on their parents policies until age 26 -RRB- show that we have fallen far short of eliminating the problem . And , some analysts do make the mistake of confusing enrollment with becoming insured and maintaining insurance coverage . Generally there is a 15 % to 20 % attrition rate in the individual marketplace for people who enroll but either fail to make their initial premium payment or discontinue paying -LRB- and thus their coverage -RRB- after a few months . There is little reason to think that the law will change human nature so the net impact on the number of uninsured Americans will probably be further diluted as the year progresses . When one takes into account that many enrollees being counted were previously insured under plans no longer compliant with the law 's requirements you have a fairly large amount of the enrollment really just being a transfer from one insured status to another . The end result is that there are fewer uninsured Americans today than there were a year ago but that number has not been reduced dramatically . "}

Insurance brokers have an in-depth knowledge of products from many different carriers and can help you determine the plan that 's going to best serve your needs and your budget .

{"input": "Why Do Health Insurance Rates Increase? ", "output": "Health insurance rates increase because the underlying cost of health care services increases every year and our population 's average consumption of health care services has been increasing for many years . If the cost of gasoline steadily rises and at the same time you are driving more miles each year then you understand it costs you more to operate your car . Health care services are the gasoline and using more health care per person is the increased miles driven part of the analogy above . That addresses the basic economic factors that have been happening for decades . Now add to those the impacts of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- and you have a whole new set of cost drivers being added to the equation . For example , ObamaCare does add taxes and fees to insurance plan costs and medical devices - these costs are passed on to the consumer . The law mandates that a wide range of preventive health care services must be covered at 100 % , all policies must cover maternity -LRB- many individual policies did n't -RRB- , no medical underwriting is allowed , polices must be guaranteed to be issued and pre-existing conditions must be covered immediately , and these are just some highpoints of the coverage changes now required . While all of these requirements may sound good , and they do benefit many people , there is no way around the fact that such changes will increase health care consumption even further . More demand for a finite resource equals higher costs . An aging American population is also a driver of increased health care consumption and , with the Baby Boom generation entering their retirement years , will be for years to come . This gives you a generaloutline of why your health insurance rates have been increasing and will continue to be increasing for the foreseeable future . As I described above , our nation has many structural issues that drive health insurance rates higher . Despite its name , the Affordable Care Act serves mainly to expand access to health insurance and health care but does very little to address any of the underlying factors that lead to higher health insurance rates .

The owner can change the beneficiaries and features of the policy without consent from the Insured , Beneficiaries , or Payor . "}
{"input": "What Does Ownership Of A Life Insurance Policy Mean? ", "output": "That is a great question ! The terms used in life insurance policies can be confusing . There are three entities in a policy - the owner , the insured , and the beneficiary . The easiest one is the beneficiary - the person or entity -LRB- trust , estate , etc. -RRB- that receives the benefits from the policy . They receive these benefits when the insured passes away . The insured is the person whose need was the reason for the policy . Here 's where it can be confusing . The owner is the person who has legal rights to the policy on the insured . That legal title gives them right to change some of the moving parts of the policy , including the beneficiary . In many cases , the owner and the insured are the same person . I buy a policy on my own life . I am the owner and the insured , and I name my wife as my beneficiary . I retain the option to change the beneficiary -LRB- should she pass first God forbid -RRB- and the right to use the cash value within the policy . If I bought a policy for my children , I would own the policy , but my child would be the insured , and my wife and I the beneficiaries . I can transfer that ownership to my child once they are able to make the payments , and manage the policy successfully . Once they own the policy , they are free to change the beneficiary to whomever they choose -LRB- their wife or child , say -RRB- . Hopefully that clears things up for you .

{"input": "What Is Direct Auto Insurance? ", "output": "Direct auto insurance is not a type of auto insurance , but a way to buy or method of selling auto insurance . Some auto insurance companies , like USAA & Amica , do not have insurance agents representing them , and sell auto insurance -LRB- and other types of insurance -RRB- direct to the public only . Auto insurance companies selling direct to the public staff call centers with licensed insurance representatives employed by the company , to sell and service the company 's insurance products . Although I think most people benefit from receiving the personal service of an agent , accountable to the customer for providing customer service , advice , and assistance , both USAA & Amica have excellent reputations for claims & customer service . Companies like GEICO & Progressive are known for selling direct to the public , though GEICO has agents available in many large metropolitan areas , and Progressive also sells through independent insurance agents , though the products and rates will be different than buying direct . When you call a company selling direct for an auto insurance quote , you speak with a company employee licensed to sell insurance , working from a call center , most likely out-of state -LRB- but not outside of the USA -RRB- . If you buy the auto insurance policy , there is no one person at the company responsible for your account , as there would be , if you purchased a policy through an agent . So , a company employee sells you the auto insurance policy , but if you call back with a question , or to make a policy change liking adding or removing a car , whichever employee answering the phone will help you , much like you receive help when you call your cable TV company . GEICO & Progressive seem to compete on price more than other companies , but buying direct does not always mean a better price . Selling direct mean no agent commissions to pay , but selling direct has other costs , like more marketing costs for TV & media ads , employee salaries and benefits . A wise auto insurance shopper decides on the coverage they need , then check the rates of all the major auto insurance companies in their state , regardless of whether the company sells direct , through their own local agents , or through independent insurance agents .

{"input": "Which Homeowners Insurance Company Is Best? ", "output": "The best insurance company is the company that pays the most when you have a loss . All insurance companies are companies that manage a pool of similar risks . Every insurance company is regulated by the insurance commissioner in the state where the company is organized and the state where the company is allowed to transact business . This combination of state supervision is designed to make sure that each company keeps their promises . There are rating bureaus that offer information concerning various insurance companies . These bureaus generally give higher ratings to larger companies with longer histories . They are rating the financial capacity of the companies . While this is a good indicator of which insurance company to choose it is far from the only criteria . Ultimately most people buy homeowners insurance from an agent . That agent might represent one company or one hundred companies . The point is that the relationship is not with the company as much as it is with the agent . People buy insurance from people that they trust . A good agent will listen to you , provide sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and the insurance company . The agent will propose a company . Few reject the company selected by the agent . The role of the company is to keep the promises that it makes . There are a wide range of homes for insurance companies to insure . Some companies have an appetite for homes that are in the mountains or heavily wooded areas . Other companies will not even consider such a risk . Some companies will insure homes on bluffs overlooking the ocean while others wont consider such a risk . Underwriting will often have special rules regarding roof type , location of an evaporative cooler , presence of certain pets and presence of certain types of recreational equipment . There are many reasons for some of these underwriting decisions but the agent will be able to identify the best company for you . The underwriter will try to suggest appropriate coverages . Even if you had the most highly rated company if the limits selected are not adequate , you could be left with a large loss in the event of a disaster . For example , you might have a significant amount of jewelry , photographic equipment , or musical instruments . If these are not insured correctly their loss could represent a significant financial loss for you . The most significant area of underinsuring is liability . Your agent should let you know the highest amount that the company will provide . If you choose less coverage , any loss in excess to the limit in the policy will come out of your assets . Your agent should tell you about the availability of umbrella liability coverage . A lawsuit can make havoc out of the best financial plan . Finally the way that the company pays the loss when you have a claim is the most critical factor . Homeowners claims are infrequent but tend to be severe . It is important that the agent you have selected assists you during this critical period . Maintaining communications with you during a claim is an identification of a really good insurance company .

Plan G is the second most popular plan because it 's identical to plan F except it does n't cover the Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- . So how do you decide between the two ? It comes down to price .

{"input": "How Can Life Insurance Be An Investment?

The interest credited to a VUL policy is based on stocks & bonds and may be positive or negative for the year . There are other types of life insurance that can accumulate cash called whole life and universal life policies . I consider these savings vehicles rather than investment vehicles because they do not lose money due to a decrease in the stock market or index . Whole Life insurance accumulates cash by dividends that are declared by the life insurance company . Universal life , other than VUL , comes in a fixed and an indexed universal life option . The Fixed UL earns interest based on a rate declared by the insurance company . The Indexed option -LRB- IUL -RRB- earns interest based on the performance of an index such as the S & P. With an IUL , there is usually a floor of 0 - 2 % that protects the cash value if the index is negative . The nice thing about an IUL is that you participate in the upside of the market without the downside risk . These are complex products and it is important to speak with a knowledgeable advisor who can educate you on the fees and other particulars . "}

{"input": "How Can Life Insurance Be An Investment? ", "output": "That is a great question ! I think that there is a lot of confusion about investments and life insurance . Life insurance is a very important part of a healthy financial plan , but should not be considered as an investment in a technical sense . Let me explain it like this : A healthy financial plan is composed of two basic parts - income builders , and protections . Your income builders are hopefully your stocks , 401k 's , annuities , bonds , etc. . The protectors are your insurances , and emergency savings account . You will not derive any income in most cases from any insurance policy -LRB- There are policies that are hyped as revenue building , but carefully read the fine print , and you will see that often the gains are built on optimistic returns , and large investments on your part , and have a substantial risk attached -RRB- as you will no longer be around to receive it . It will provide that income to whomever you chose as your beneficiary . So the only fair way to describe life insurance as an investment is to say that it is an investment in your loved ones ' financial safety , and in your peace of mind knowing that you 've protected them from harm , even after you 've passed .

One year Term , or Annually Renewable Term , can be helpful for someone in between jobs or some other need for very short term coverage . However , one year Term will go up in price each year , and sometimes you need to re-qualify every year . So locking in a longer term is much easier and more cost effective if you need more than a couple years of coverage . Five year Term is hard to find , and thus the prices are not as competitive as one would think . I have found that ten year Term rates often run as low or lower than five year Term . Since there is no penalty to drop Term life insurance , you may as well take the longer term and then just drop it if you do n't need it the whole ten years . Ten year Term policies are common and competitively priced . Again , if you need longer coverage , it can cost less to lock the rate in longer while you are younger and your health is good . But if you are going for short term coverage , 10 or 15 year Term can be a good way to go . "}

Heart disease refers to items such as coronary artery disease , the placement of stents , bypass surgery , pacemaker , heart valve transplant , and other heart conditions . High cholesterol would not require a yes response . When looking for coverage , it 's important to compare multiple carriers for the coverage . Your full medical history will determine the risk classification you can qualify for - the risk class determines what the rates will be for coverage . In addition , every carrier has their own underwriting guidelines , meaning that each carrier can assign a different risk class to the same medical profile - one carrier may consider standard where another one may consider preferred . Your height/weight profile , prescriptions you 're taking , current conditions under treatment , conditions treated in the last 10 + years , any tobacco usage , and other factors affect the risk classifications carriers will consider . Determining the availability for preferred rates for your program would be best discussed with an independent insurance agent who can review your medical history , evaluate the risk class considerations , and compare a variety of options for you to make sure you 're securing the coverage at the lowest possible cost . Depending on how old the existing policy is , whether it 's term or permanent insurance , and what the premium is on it , you may want to consider securing a new policy that totals what the coverage would be if kept separately .

When you call you can expect to have an automated service answer your call , following the obligatory `` Press 1 for English '' you will be told to `` Please listen carefully as our options have changed '' .

{"input": "Is Landlord Insurance More Expensive Than Homeowners? ", "output": "The answer here is `` maybe '' . It really depends upon the situation and the coverage . In general , if you consider the same house and the same coverage , the homeowners coverage will cost you less . let 's start with some terms . In the industry , we usually call landlord insurance either dwelling fire , or a dwelling policy . It points to the difference between this and a homeowners policy . A homeowners policy has 6 coverages : A. Dwelling - the structure B . Other Structures - detached garages , shed 's , pole barns , etc. . C. Personal Property - Your stuff D. Loss of Use - The extra costs you 'll incur if you have to live somewhere while your home is repaired E. Personal Liability - Protects you from being sued F. Medical Payments - Pays for injuries that happen on your property without having to be sued . A Dwelling Policy , in general does n't have any coverage C , Personal Property . As a landlord , you 're worried about the building and your liability . Your tenant 's personal property is their responsibility to insure . Dwelling policies are more complicated to put together than homeowners policies but I 'll leave that discussion for another time . Lets talk about why Dwelling Policy usually costs more than a Homeowners policy . With a homeowners policy the insurance company has a greater sense of security because they only have one entity to worry about , the homeowners and their family . They have a financial interest in keeping their home safe , secure , and in good repair . With a rental property , you may have many different tenants occupy that home and they have no financial interest in the home itself . A tenant is much more likely to let things go that may eventually cause a claim . Additionally , with a homeowners policy , the liability is protecting the insured from others , with a dwelling policy , you 're also being protected from the people that actually occupy the home . Now , one last thing to mention . If you 're renting your home and it 's insured on a homeowners policy , change it now . If there 's a claim on the home and the insurance company finds out it 's being rented , they may refuse to pay your claim . Most homeowners policies require the home to be occupied by the owner for coverage to apply . Find a good agent that knows how this works and how to put this coverage together for your situation . It 's much better to know what your coverage is and make choices rather then to think you have coverage you really do n't "}

{"input": "What To Do With Universal Life Insurance? ", "output": "That is a great question ! And an interesting one . I guess the answer depends upon how long you 've had the policy , and how well you 've kept track of it ; or whether it is a good policy to get at all , if I 'm reading into your question rightly . Here 's what I advise people . A UL policy can be a good thing if you are somebody that keeps an eye on everything , and has extra money lying around . You also have to have a healthy risk tolerance . Agents will rightly tell you that this type of policy can bring great returns , but press them hard , and make them tell you exactly what stars and moons need to align for that to happen . What is the actual performance of the policy over time , not the best case scenario printed in the sales brochure ? How much over the minimum payment is required to achieve that performance ? That 's what you need to know if you are thinking of purchasing one . If you already have one , are you paying attention to how well it is still funded ? You could be in for a surprise if you have n't . Call your agent , and get an idea of how it 's doing for you , and how long you can expect it to be in force . Functionally , you can use the proceeds for everything that you would any other whole life insurance policy . I hope that helps , thanks for asking ! "}

{"input": "Does AARP Offer Term Life Insurance? ", "output": "AARP does not offer any life insurance - they are only a marketing organization . They associate themselves with certain insurers and allow the carriers to attach their name to a product . For example , life insurance is typically done through New York Life while Medicare Supplement insurance is typically done through United Healthcare . One of my family members who is an AARP member gets letters in the mail frequently for life insurance with the AARP name -LRB- insurance through New York Life -RRB- . However , the coverage is age-banded and only carries the policy through age 80 - the coverage then terminates if they live beyond age 80 with no option to extend the program . Age-banded coverage means the rates change every 5 years as you enter into the next age bracket . They may have other life insurance products available with their name on attached , but that 's what constantly comes in the mail . If you 're looking for term life insurance , I would highly highly highly suggest consulting with an independent agent who can compare multiple carriers for you and discuss your medical history to determine the risk classification each carrier may consider you for -LRB- the risk class directly determines the premiums -RRB- .

You can end up spending extra money that you do n't need to when you do that -LRB- that 's not to say a big name carrier would n't in fact be the best cost option , you just want to be sure you 're not overpaying -RRB- . The risk class is key to figure out first and then look at the rates for a given coverage amount/term length from there . If you do n't know what risk class you would likely fall under for a carrier , then a quote is nothing more than a guesstimate . Term life insurance is very straightforward . If you die during the life of the policy , the carrier pays out the death benefit proceeds . If you outlive the term premium guarantee period and and do n't want to pay the annual renewable term rates -LRB- which go up each year as you get older -RRB- , then you would likely either replace it with a new term or permanent life insurance policy or not have any coverage .

{"input": "How Long Does Universal Life Insurance Last? ", "output": "Universal life insurance is a type of permanent insurance program - meaning it can last for the rest of your life . Most universal life policies -LRB- UL -RRB- will pay a death benefit up to age 121 so you can make sure the death benefit will be paid out at some point in the future . UL policies can be dialed down to a specified age -LRB- to age 90 , to age 100 , etc. -RRB- to reduce the premiums - please note , doing so affects the guarantees and assumptions inside the policy . There are several different types of universal life - Guaranteed UL , Current Assumption UL , Indexed UL , and Variable UL . If you 're just buying coverage for the purposes of the death benefit , you would likely want to look at a Guaranteed UL or Current Assumption UL as they will almost always maximize your dollar to death benefit ratio -LRB- meaning you 're getting the most bang for your buck in terms of death benefit -RRB- . With permanent insurance , there has to be money in the cash value to keep the policy going - if the cash value hits $ 0 , then the policy crashes and is no longer paying coverage . Guaranteed ULs are a great way to protect against this because they state that even if the cash value hits $ 0 , the policy will still pay a death benefit as long as you 're still paying your premium . When you 're looking to buy life insurance , you should talk to an independent insurance agent who can work with you on a personal level and help you determine what program structure will be most suitable for your needs and budget and which carrier will work with your medical history best to offer the coverage to you at the lowest possible cost -LRB- independent agents generally work with a multitude of insurance companies and can sell a wide range of carriers ' products -RRB- .

{"input": "How Do I Borrow Against My Life Insurance? ", "output": "That is a great question ! You need to have a whole life policy to be able to borrow anything . Term policies have no cash value to borrow from , so the first step is to determine what policy you have . The second step is to see how long the policy has been in force . If it has only been a year or two , in most cases there wo n't be anything yet to borrow . If the policy is a few years old , the company can tell you what your borrowable amount is . They will send you a form , and after processing it , a check . Hope that helps , and thanks for asking ! "}

{"input": "Is Life Insurance Necessary For A Mortgage? ", "output": "It depends on your definition of `` necessary '' . It used to be common practice for mortgage companies to sell credit life insurance that would pay the mortgage in the case of the borrower 's death . These policies are n't sold much anymore because they were n't really a good value for the borrower . The rates were high and the death benefits fell over time with the balance of the mortgage . It 's usually a good practice to have life insurance in place to pay off any debts you have including a mortgage . To do this the right way you really need to consider the bigger picture of your life . A mortgage is just one piece of the puzzle that is your financial life . When considering how much life insurance you need , you have to determine what will happen if you die and where that will leave the survivors . Find an agent you can trust and go through the process of this planning . Nobody likes thinking about their death , but the situation exists whether you plan for it or not . "}
{"input": "Who Pays For Indemnity Health Insurance? ", "output": "Indemnity insurance is a form of health insurance that pays a fixed amount per service or for a period of time . For example , an indemnity policy might pay $ 50 towards a doctor 's office visit . This means that regardless of the total cost of that visit to the doctor the indemnity policy pays $ 50 . Another common example is the indemnity policy may pay $ 500 per day that the policyholder is in the hospital . If the policy holder had a 2 day hospital stay that cost $ 8000 the policy would pay $ 1000 -LRB- $ 500 x 2 -RRB- and the policy holder would be responsible for the remaining $ 7000 in hospital expenses . There are many variations on the indemnity policy theme and they are often combined with accident and/or critical illness policies to provide more financial protection . In any event , indemnity policies are not major medical policies and by design provide defined and limited financial protection to the policy holder . These policies were really designed more as a supplement to major medical insurance than as a replacement for it . If you have a premature baby that racks up $ 500,000 in neonatal intensive care bills an indemnity policy will not go very far towards covering that expense . Also , indemnity policies do not meet the Minimum Essential Benefit requirements for health insurance under the affordable care act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- and will leave such a policyholder subject to the individual mandate tax penalty if that is the only medical insurance a person has . With the high cost of ObamaCare compliant plans the lower costs of hospital indemnity plans can be a tempting option for some people but you should be under no illusion that these policies cover the full range of medical services a person might need or that they provide protection against the costs of serious illnesses or injuries that might run into the 5 , 6 or 7 figure range .

I guess the answer to this question would best be found on AARP 's website for life insurance . I think it might be more important to look at the insurance offered with those 3 questions .

This plan is a 5 year level term policy , which means every five years the cost will increase . The policy ends at age 80 , with nothing to convert over to . So if you need coverage beyond age 80 , you will be shopping again . Pricing wise , because of the few questions asked , the price tends to be high . This would be true of any insurance company that asks only a few questions . What you do n't ask about , you charge for .

Most who carry Medicare Supplements will also be able to assist you with Part D coverage as well . There are also Medicare `` Advocates '' in many states who are trained by Medicare . They can be a tremendous help in educating people about Medicare in general , what product choices that a person will have & usually can assist in Part D enrollment . What I have found with these people is that even if they can discuss all of the supplement plans with someone - they can not actually enroll them , since they are not salespeople . But , they are a very good source of agnostic information . In addition , there are many online sources to run quotes & see rates . Even though that sounds like a good way to shop , it does n't provide overall education about differences in various companies , the issue basis of the policies being quoted , or any state specific laws and rules that could impact the person applying in the future .

If you have recently turned 65 you are no doubt inundated with mail solicitations . All of this is too confusing for most people . Buying without help is not advised . You can call Medicare direct , and some states have people who will answer your questions and help you decide . But how do you know if that person has enough experience to give you helpful answers ? This may be their first week on the job . Some think they will get a better `` deal '' if they buy direct from a carrier . Again , you never know anything about the person you are talking to , and how do you know they will be available to answer future questions ? Or you can go online . This is convenient but there are challenges here as well . Unless you visit a site from a local agent , you are probably giving up your personal information to a stranger in another state that will sell that information to numerous agents .

{"input": "How To Shop For Medicare Supplemental Insurance? ", "output": "When shopping for Medicare Supplement do not just go by rates . Many agents will tell you that all plans are the same and the only difference is rates , and that is true .

Unless you like changing plans every year and you know your health will always be good , this is not necessarily the best way to go . Look for a company that is competitive , but that has a good history of rate increases , generally less than 10 % . Every agent is getting solicited by companies wanting them to sell their now lowest rate plan . Find a good local agent who has been around for a while . I personally like the AARP Med Sup . It is competitive and has an excellent rate history . It also uses community rating versus attained age rating . With attained age , which most companies use , you pay a low rate at first but every year you can count on a rate increase just because you got older , in addition to the rate increase the company has . With community rating , the rates are equaled over the ages so that you pay a little more at 65 for example but when you are 85 your rates will be lower than if you went with an attained age company . Also look for an agent that also does Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug plans . He will be able to help you decide which would be to your best advantage . "}

What you get out of the annuity will vary a lot as well because each carrier that offers annuities will offer different interest rates so one company may offer a large payout to you than another even though you 're putting in the same amount of money either way . This is where an independent annuity broker comes in handy because they can work with you on a personal level , compare options from multiple carriers to see which will offer you the best payout , and get your annuity set up - plus , brokers do not charge fees for their services so you can only help yourself . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance and if you have any further questions . Thanks very much . "}
{"input": "How Does Guaranteed Universal Life Insurance Work? ", "output": "How does Guaranteed Universal Life work ? Just like level term . Think of it as lifetime level term . With term insurance you pay a premium every month and you have coverage . With GUL you pay the premium every month and you have coverage . The GUL rider on a polcy states that as long as the premium is paid and the policy values remain untouched the company will pay a death claim out to the age chosen by the insured . It could be to age 90 , 100 , 110 , 121 or until passing . The big thing with a GUL vs. a Level term policy is cash values . With level term the insured does not see the cash values generated by the level term policy during it 's level premium run . With level term you overpay early to underpay later and this keeps the premium constant . Same with GUL except now you can ` touch '' the money inside the policy . This is a bad thing if you want the guarantee to remain in place . You simply do not want to mess with your GUL beyond paying your monthly premium every month .

{"input": "How Is Life Insurance Used In Estate Planning? ", "output": "Estate planning is preparing how your estate will be distributed and minimizing/paying off applicable estate taxes upon your death . Life insurance can be used to pay the estate taxes . A common course of action people take to minimize the estate taxes they will be subject to is creating an irrevocable life insurance trust -LRB- ILIT -RRB- . An ILIT is a legal document set up to distribute life insurance proceeds in a specific manner , depending on how the trust is designed . These trusts receive special tax consideration from the IRS that is not given to life insurance policies that would otherwise be owned by a natural person or revocable trust . Since the trust is irrevocable , the terms of the trust can not be changed . An ILIT can offer many substantial advantages to protect life insurance proceeds and help you distribute your property to your children at the least possible cost . The IRS code permits a unified tax credit to pass a certain value of property without having to pay a tax . When you exceed that value -LRB- a taxable estate -RRB- , a massive tax is applied that must be paid within 9 months of death . If the decedent is single , the tax is due accordingly . If the decedent is married , the tax is due after the second death -LRB- death of the spouse -RRB- . So the question becomes , would you rather pay the estate tax with 100 % of your own money -LRB- with after-tax dollars -RRB- or would you rather pay only a fraction of the tax and use someone else 's money to pay the rest -LRB- the insurance company -RRB- . If you want the latter , you can purchase a life insurance policy . The type of policy you should set up will depend on the specific circumstances , but for many situations it will usually be a survivorship universal life policy if the proceeds are to be used for estate tax purposes . Any life insurance policy you buy will require the same premium whether you put the policy in the trust or keep it outside of the trust . If you put the policy in the trust , the death benefit is not included in the calculation of the size of the estate - a substantial tax savings and key advantage in the estate planning process . If you keep the policy outside of the trust -LRB- e.g. , as owned by a natural person or a revocable trust -RRB- , the proceeds will be included in calculating the size of the estate you may inadvertently increase the size of the estate , and be subject to paying much higher estate taxes before any of the property can be distributed to your children or other beneficiaries .

"}
{"input": "Does Owning A Home Affect Car Insurance? ", "output": "Before the advent of the use of the use of a credit score and multi-variant rating formulas , rate making relied upon what the industry referred to as `` stability factors '' to arrive at rates . Stability factors are things like age , marital status , whether you have a job , have children , and similar types of considerations . The idea was -LRB- and is today -RRB- a person had a better chance of being profitable as a customer -LRB- from the insurer 's point of view -RRB- if you are stable . So , stability factors were things about you and your life that reflect upon your commitment to stability . Owning a house was certainly a stability factor . Today , the rate making logic is decided on a similar assumption about your stability as a customer but we lean harder on credit as an -LRB- all encompassing -RRB- indicator than we do on these other factors . However , most carriers have more than one rate that is possible depending upon answers to the stability factors that are being considered , with credit score and claims history being primary factors . Because the question is an open question subject to more than one interpretation , owning a home does enter into auto insurance from a stability point of view , and a rate point of view . Carriers understand that customers with auto or home , but not both , have more claims and cost more on claims . Those with auto and home together with one carrier will be -LRB- on average -RRB- 15-20 % less costly to insured from the claims point of view . That is why carriers offer auto-home multi-line discounts because they know the customer will be a better risk , incur fewer losses , and have losses that cost less , than the customers with only a single line of business with the carrier . So , it is true that owning a home does have an impact on auto insurance . Now , where it is n't likely to have any impact is on the policy coverage itself . Home and auto policies alike are written to provide the coverage intended so having a homeowner policy is n't likely going to impact the coverage on your auto policy . These are the three possible paths your question creates -LRB- in my assessment -RRB- so yes , having home insurance does impact auto insurance from a cost and underwriting perspective , but not from any coverage issue by and large .

{"input": "Who Should Buy Long Term Care Insurance? ", "output": "A better question would be `` Who Should n't Buy Long-term Care Insurance '' ? Thats simpler to answer . The following people should NOT buy long term care insurance : 1 . Those that can not afford the premium on even a base policy . 2 . Those that have virtually no assets to pass on to the next generationand will need every available dollar saved for retirement . 3 . Those that will have to work until they die for lack of savings and insufficient Social Security payments or private pension . 4 . Those that can not medically qualify . 5 . Those that are already unable to perform regular daily activities of living without assistance . People in those conditions may qualify for the payment of long-term care through Medicaid -LRB- MediCal in California -RRB- if they come to a point in their life where they need care and ca n't afford it . If the above conditions describe you in any way , you should be sitting down with your adult children or closest relatives and coming up with a plan of action should you be unable to take care of yourself . Everyone else should consider buying some long-term care insurance through an agent or agency that either specializes or has a specialist that is experienced in handling long-term care insurance casework . Having some amount of insurance is better than having none . When one qualifies to receive payments from the insurance company for long-term care , they are usually near the end of their life . The average long-term care claim is approximately 2 - 2.5 years . For those that need care longer than that , virtually all but the most unusual claims are paid out after 5 years . Families with a history of late-life mental illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers -RRB- should consider buying a larger pool of money than others , if they can afford it . It is in the best interest of the adult children to help out with long-term care premium payments if the elderly parents can not afford to pay all of the costs . Long-term care is an emotional , psychological , sociological , and family problem as much as it is financial . For the dignity of those who need care and the people or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs to be a plan of action determined and long-term care insurance should be a part of that plan if it can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term care insurance is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during the life of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design of the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one needs long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there 's not much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility . "}
{"input": "How Do I Meet My Health Insurance Deductible? ", "output": "Your health insurance deductible is the amount that the covered individual must pay out of their own pocket before the health insurance plan begins paying for covered health care expenses . Deductibles can vary from one insurance policy to another . As an example , let 's say you have a health insurance policy with a $ 2000 deductible followed by 100 % co-insurance coverage after that amount.You are thenhospitalized for heart surgery under this policy and the total bill is $ 50,000 . You would be 100 % financially responsible for the first $ 2000 of that bill -LRB- your deductible -RRB- and the health insurance carrier would pay the remaining $ 48,000 . You have `` met '' your deductible by incurring expenses in excess of your plan 's deductible . As many healthcare providers and hospitals will tell you , there is a difference in someone `` meeting '' their deductible and actually paying their deductible expenses . So , inour example , as long as the policy holder keeps paying their health insurance premiums their health insurance will remain in effect even if the policy holder pays none or only a portion of their $ 2000 deductible amount . This is why a growing number of consumers are receiving demands for upfront payment of their deductible and co-insurance cost sharing amounts from some healthcare providers before they will provide services . I just had a friend ask me about this very situation for one of her coworkers who had recently learned she was pregnant and who was told by their OB/GYN that they wanted payment for the person 's $ 1500 deductible and their 30 % co-insurance cost sharing for the OB/GYN to provide their services to that person .

{"input": "Why Has Homeowners Insurance Gone Up? ", "output": "Homeowner 's insurance premiums have gone up because the average coverage on homes has increased over the years .

Platinum plans are going to provide the most comprehensive benefits , but will also feature the highest premiums . Not everyone will be able to afford a platinum plan , which is why bronze , silver , and gold are available as well . The idea being to reduce your premium , you take on a little more risk - meaning you 're willing to take on a higher deductible , higher coinsurance/copayment , etc. to keep your premiums down . You may also want to see if group coverage is available through your employer . Group coverage can provide many benefits as well , such as lower premiums -LRB- the employer contributes to a percentage of the premiums for each employees plan -RRB- - the trade-off to keep in mind is that for group plans , if you left the company or your employment was terminated , you lose the coverage .

{"input": "Can You Buy Motorcycle Insurance For 1 Month? ", "output": "Would you buy that coverage if they charged you the equivalent of six months premium ? Issuing a policy for a month is as expensive as issuing coverage for a year . The cost of insurance is calculated using an assumption that the policy will last the length of the term , be it six months or a year . That is why a `` short-rate '' table exists to calculate the premium earned when a policy is cancelled before the end of the policy term . A short rate is recognition of the administrative burden and the cost is passed along in the premium you are charged . You can buy a policy on a six month term or for a year and then just cancel it but do n't expect the actual cost for a month of insurance to be equal to 1/6th of 1/12th of the premium . It is likely to be much higher . But it is possible to end up with coverage for one month . You just may not like the premium charge when you 're done with the coverage . "}

{"input": "How To Use PPO Health Insurance?

In simplest terms the health insurance carrier negotiates a payment contract with a medical system that makes it 's affiliated physicians , facilities and other providers the `` in-network '' providers where people who enroll in that insurance company 's products will receive the highest level of benefits/coverage . Generally PPO 's allow their members to directly access the health care system at any level and as long as you are using a provider who is in the PPO network the member receives the higher in-network level of benefits . This means that there is little or no gatekeeper mechanism in place that requires the member to receive a referral from their primary care physician in order to see a specialist or obtain other more complex medical services . For the consumer to effectively use PPO health insurance they should learn how to determine whothe in-network providers are for their health plan -LRB- most easily done by going online to the insurance company 's web site -RRB- and to use those providers for their health care needs .

{"input": "How Much Does Home Insurance Increase After A Claim? ", "output": "Home Insurance contracts differ in all States ; they are all governed by the Department/Division of Insurance dictating exactly how to abide by the rules of the particular State . Once abiding by the rules of each State , carriers also have differences in handling claims and policy adjustments thereafter . In States where a Claims Free discount is allowed , the discount will be removed on the following renewal if a claim has been filed , there may also be a claims surcharge assessed in addition . Some carriers have allowances for small claims below a certain pay out whereby the insured would lose the Claims Free discount but not be assessed a further surcharge.Since it will be close to impossible to get a clear answer to this question , the following is the best rule of thumb for policyholders : DO NOT USE YOUR INSURANCE POLICY AS A CHECK BOOK ! Property Insurance is meant to protect the insured against unforeseen and unaffordable sudden & accidental perils . The home should always be well maintained and display pride of ownership for ` preferred ' risks . For example , if due to high winds a branch would be blown off a tree and simply break a window or damage a few roof tiles , this is typically not what one would purchase insurance for ; on the other hand , if there is an unforeseen electrical fault causing a house fire or perhaps the occurrence of a devastating storm , this is where insurance becomes an essential part of the recovery process . Insurance contracts are designed with a Deductible ; the deductible is the amount deducted from a Claims Payout . The actual purpose of the Deductible is to reduce the carrier 's risk exposure to small claims , the lower the deductible , the higher the premium . Clients that purchase insurance with a higher deductible make a statement acknowledging that small claims will not be brought to the carrier thus prompting the carrier to accept a lower premium for a lower risk exposure . Once a claim is filed with a Home Insurance Carrier , a claims number is assigned and the claim is reported electronically to the National Claims Database -LRB- CLUE -RRB- . The purpose of this reporting process is for the industry to share information regarding the risk thereby deterring any dishonest practices in attempting to misrepresent risk to an alternate carrier at a future point . This is a great tool that has been used for many years preventing carriers from taking on adverse risk . The answer to this question was carefully orchestrated to provide a better understanding regarding the underwriting and claims process which would lead ultimately to premium assessment . It is strongly suggested that home owners fully understand this process and contact a licensed professional to answer any further questions regarding the process . "}

{"input": "Why Was Universal Life Insurance Created? ", "output": "I think it was created to solve some very real problems with life insurance at the time , which was in the 70s and 80s . Up to that point whole life insurance was the only permanent product available . This product can be expensive because of the strong guarantees it provides .

Even if you have deviations in cash flow , you have to stick to the payment schedule in order to retain your coverage . That can be an obstacle for people who fund their premium out of business proceeds , which can go up and down . One of the best revisions to this product has been the recent inclusion of a lifetime guarantee . You can basically lock into rates for the rest of your life . It wont develop much cash , but it really solves the problem of paying the lowest premium on a guaranteed basis forever . In this way kind of functions as a permanent term insurance .

Buying health insurance online , whether it 's through the government marketplaces or private sites , is not like shopping around for the best deal on a hotel room or an airplane ticket . You will encounter a bizarre world of seemingly similar looking insurance products with wildly different prices or similarly priced products with wildly different benefit designs . I guide people through this maze and it really does n't matter if they have a 10th grade education or a PhD , they are amazed at the subtle differences I have to point out that make the real differences in the health insurance products they purchase . For example , one insurance carrier here in Tennessee offers identical insurance products in the government marketplace but has three different PPO network options attached to them . The average person would look at these products , determine that the benefits are the same and so why not pick the one with the lowest monthly premium ? What they have painfully learned later is that they have enrolled in a health plan with a very narrow network of doctors , hospitals and pharmacies . The hospital a few miles from their house that they assumed was in-network because it is part of the overall health system they have been familiar with in the past turns out not to be included in this narrow network product and instead they may have to go across town or to another county -LRB- in more rural areas -RRB- to go to an in-network hospital . Another major carrier uses terms like `` Local Preferred '' and `` National Preferred '' to differentiate their products . A quick scan of the benefit summaries reveals only slight differences in office visit & prescription copays , deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums but unless you really dig deep you wo n't be able to figure out one limits your pharmacy choices significantly while the other does not . Other insurance companies whose plans people have been familiar with and even enrolled in for years have found that these company 's products have transformed into products that now require primary care referrals for visits to specialists and other services or that they provide little or no coverage outside of their immediate geographic area . Just this week I spent about 3 hours explaining his different options to a man in his early 30 's who is smart enough to run his own business and who has been my customer for 6 years . The next morning he had his mother call me so I could explain the same things to her so she could help him feel good about his final decision . This is the reality of what the average consumer is now faced with in today 's health insurance marketplace . My advice , it 's a jungle out there . Do n't go in without a trained guide and beware of these so called `` navigators '' and `` assistants '' they are unlicensed , poorly trained -LRB- perhaps good intentioned -RRB- individuals who can do little more than read the same material on a computer that you can see .

{"input": "What Is Graded Death Benefit Whole Life Insurance?

If death occurred during year one or two , it may pay back all you paid in , plus 10 % . If death occurred during year three or afterwards , it would pay the beneficiary the whole death benefit . Different policies are graded a different number of years , and each carrier has their own criteria for how much is paid back during the graded years . Most graded benefit whole life policies are only graded for natural death . I.e. death due to illness or old age . They usually pay 100 % of the death benefit from day one for accidental death . Guaranteed issue whole life policies are graded , and some simplified issue policies are graded . Simplified issue policies are those that do not require an exam . The biggest thing to watch out for with graded whole life insurance is whether the premium stays level for life . Some graded whole life policies have premiums that go up at regular intervals . With some , the company may raise the premiums at any time , as long as they do so for everyone owning that type of policy . If you anticipate living longer than a few years , it is best to buy a graded benefit whole life policy where the premium will stay level for the rest of your life .

{"input": "What Is Graded Death Benefit Whole Life Insurance? ", "output": "That is a great question ! If you are looking at whole life insurance policies , you want to look at whether the policy is an `` immediate issue '' policy , or one that is a `` graded -LRB- or `` modified '' -RRB- '' policy . An immediate issue policy is one that goes into effect as soon as the underwriting is approved , the policy is issued , and the first payment received -LRB- in some States the policy may be honored if the company issued the policy , and the payment had not yet been received -RRB- . These policies are most often written for people with great health , or people with minor health issues , as determined by that company 's underwriters . -LRB- A good independent agent can help you find the best fit . -RRB- A graded or modified policy will be issued to folks that have more significant health issues , or by companies that are mass marketing the policy - like AARP or Mutual of Omaha 's `` guaranteed everyone qualifies '' policies that you see on TV or that arrive in your mailbox . These policies will all have a period of time where the desired face value -LRB- and typically it is very small - often not more than $ 10,000 -RRB- is not paid out unless the insured dies an accidental death -LRB- as strictly defined by the insurer -RRB- . Typically any health related passing will result in a payment only of the amount you 've paid into the policy , and some amount of interest . This period is generally 2-3 years . -LRB- Again , an independent agent can help sort through companies to help you find the best grade for you . -RRB- So an `` everyone is guaranteed '' policy like AARP offers will somewhere in the small print tell you that the policy has a graded or modified benefit period of ___ years and during that period a death resulting from natural causes will result in the return of premiums paid plus __ % interest . This is done to help limit their cost over the entirety of the risk classes they will be insuring . The other companies that offer this type of policy are doing it based upon your specific health issues , and the increased risk to your mortality . For example , someone who has no diabetes , or that has controlled their disease with a regimen like Metformin will usually be a certain immediate issue candidate . Someone whose diabetes went unchecked for a while , and is on an insulin program will more often than not be issued a graded/modified policy . If that unchecked diabetes has led to complications like amputations , diabetic coma , or neuropathy , you can usually expect the more expensive guaranteed issue policy to be your only option . Again , a good agent can help you find the best fit for you . You can expect to pay less for the immediate issue policy , more for the graded policy , and most for the guaranteed issue policy . I hope that answers all of your questions , and if not , please do n't hesitate to reach out and contact me , I 'd be more than happy to spend some time answering whatever questions or concerns that you may have .

{"input": "What Is Graded Death Benefit Whole Life Insurance? ", "output": "Graded death benefit whole life insurance is permanent coverage that features an alternative structure in the first 2 or 3 years of the policy -LRB- depending on the insurance company -RRB- . The program will feature one of two graded benefit methods . 1 -RRB- Return of premium - if death occurs during the graded period , any premiums paid into the policy is given to the beneficiary . If death occurs under accidental means , then the full benefit is still payable . After the graded period has expired , the full benefit is payable regardless of whether death occurs due to illness or injury . Some carriers may offer interest on your premiums if the insured passes away during the graded period - be sure to review your policy to see if it 's under your policy . The return of premium structure is more commonly seen under graded benefit whole life policies . 2 -RRB- Reduced death benefit - if death occurs during the graded period , the coverage will payout a specific percentage of the death benefit , depending on which year during the graded period death occurs . For example , if death occurs during the first year of the policy , the carrier only pays 30 % or 35 % of the death benefit -LRB- depending on the carrier -RRB- - 70 % or 75 % if death occurs during year 2 . If death occurs under accidental means during the graded period , then the full benefit is payable . After the graded period has expired , the full benefit is payable regardless of whether death occurs by illness or injury . Under final expense policies -LRB- another name for small whole life policies with face amounts of $ 25,000 or less -RRB- , the responses to the health questions determine whether you will qualify for a level benefit -LRB- immediate full coverage -RRB- or a graded benefit . Typically , to qualify for a level benefit , all the health questions have to be answered no . Please note , just because you may not be able to answer all health questions no for one carrier 's program , does n't mean you would n't be able to answer no to all questions for a different carrier . Each insurance company has their own questions that they ask so one carrier may be able to consider a level benefit where another may not . The wording to the questions is critical to pay attention to . If you ca n't qualify for traditional final expense coverage , you always have the option for GUARANTEED ISSUE whole life . These programs do not ask any health questions whatsoever . They will feature the return of premium graded period . When buying any whole life insurance policy , be sure to remember 2 things : 1 -RRB- Do the premiums remain the same for the entire life of the policy ? - Some policies feature banded premium - meaning they go up every 5 years . They may be cheaper up front during the first couple years , but can cost significantly more over the long run . 2 -RRB- What age does the coverage carry you to ? - Some policies will only carry you to age 80 or to age 90 - and if you live beyond that age , your policy automatically terminates . It 's best to set yourself up with something that guarantees the coverage will remain in place for life -LRB- as long as you continue to pay your premiums of course -RRB- . I always suggest consulting with an independent agent who can shop the case for you and compare multiple insurance policies with your medical history to make sure you 're getting the desired coverage at the lowest possible cost . There is no cost to doing so .

{"input": "Does My Husband Have To Be On My Auto Insurance If He Doesn't Drive The Car? ", "output": "I understand it 's hard when you have a driver with , shall we say , a less than stellar driving record . Most companies , however , will want your husband to be named on your auto insurance policy . Over the years they 've realized that people drive the cars that they own whether they 're insured on a policy or not . It 's just the reality of the situation . However , that does n't mean that your rates have to be sky-high , as you put it . There are some pointers I can give you to help minimize the impact . Your husband can get his own insurance separate from yours . If his record is bad enough that he has be placed with a non standard -LRB- high risk -RRB- company , you can still have a policy through a standard company . As long as he has insurance , he does n't have to be listed as a driver on your policy . Whether you choose to have him get his own policy or list him on yours , list him on a car that does n't have physical damage coverage -LRB- comp and collision -RRB- . Physical damage coverage on a non standard policy can cost big dollars , as much as 75 % of the total cost of the insurance . Track his driving record . Any violation will eventually drop off for rating purposes . Most minor violations will drop off after two years , at fault accidents will usually drop off after three years , and major violations -LRB- DUI etc. -RRB- will drop off after five years . As soon as he 's eligible to be insured through a standard carrier , list him . Many people do n't realize this and continue to pay non standard rates even after they 're eligible . I 'll preface this last point by saying I do n't recommend it . Some companies can exclude a driver . In so doing they 're not rated on the policy and they 're record does n't matter . But realize that there is no coverage if they get into an accident , even if they 're driving a car on the policy . Once again , I do not recommend this . From time to time I see a driver that has a problem driving safely . They routinely get tickets and have accidents . Some will even just stop carrying insurance because it 's so expensive but do n't seem to see the correlation between their driving and their insurance rates . If he will , get him into a safe driving program . If he wo n't , you 'll probably be dealing with this for a long time . Good luck . "}

These types of policies are certainly considered when a commercial banking institution is measuring one 's net worth and underwriting a loan application just as bank accounts or other investment holdings . However , if the loan is for business purposes , for example , if a contractor is purchasing a major piece of equipment , a condition of the loan may be the purchase of even a short term Life policy which would then be collaterally assigned to the lending institution .

The SBA does not require life insurance on every loan so check with your lender to determine what the requirements are . The SBA website has a loan checklist you can download .

You merely need to add a collateral assignment form when you submit your application for coverage .

Universal is permanent , and will never end , so long as you continue to pay , unlike term whose premiums will increase after the end of a fixed term .

It is possible with universal that you may have to put more money in that expected , if the market were to take a serious hit . This would not happen with whole life . A way to avoid this is to buy indexed universal life .

{"input": "What Does A Salvage And Recovery Clause Mean? ", "output": "Salvage and recovery relates to subrogation and rights of recovery that an insurance company reserves for themselves after indemnifying you for a loss . The entire concept of salvage , recovery , subrogation , and indemnification fill up text books . Insurance is a contract and in the contract the insurance company has been asked by you , in exchange for mutual understandings and agreements , to provide protection against certain kinds of losses . When your insurance company indemnifies you for your loss , they replace you in position of right in many situations . For example , if your car were damaged beyond repair , the carrier pays to you the value of the car and in doing so , assumes right and title to the salvage value of your car . They sell this salvage to businesses that resell the usable parts and the insurance company uses the money they collect to lower the final dollar cost of paying your loss to you . Recovery usually relates to the right of the carrier to pursue `` recovery '' from the responsible , negligent party who damaged your car . This process is referred to as subrogating and the carrier seeks to recovery from the at-fault and negligent driver -LRB- under tort laws -RRB- all or a portion of the amounts they paid to make you whole after your loss . Another closely related provision in your insurance is the right of `` abandonment '' . Insurance companies do not grant you the right to abandon your property so you can collect a larger reimbursement . This may come up during the settlement of pairs and sets , like ear rings . The insurance company will not let you surrender -LRB- abandon -RRB- to them the other ear ring so you can make the insurance carrier liable for a larger amount so you can buy a new set of ear rings . The obligation of the carrier is to the amount of the the loss even if only a partial loss . That 's why your company will repair a car rather than pay you the full value when there is a partial loss . There are other places where salvage comes up , like in inland and ocean marine , but for the vast bulk of readers the latter answers explain how these terms impact your coverage and how your insurance company will deal with you . "}
{"input": "What Does A Salvage And Recovery Clause Mean? ", "output": "When the insured receives payment of an adjusted claim , the property that is damaged becomes the property of the insurance company . Often that damaged property is of little value . However , particularly in the case of an automobile , the car may be salvaged and the insurance company may realize part or all of the adjusted claim payment . The term comes primarily from ocean marine insurance . Often a ship will have a fire in the hold . An adjuster will fly out to the ship while it is underway , evaluate the loss and the insurance company may adjust the claim before the ship even reaches port . That portion of the property that has been declared as loss becomes the property of the insurance company . There are companies that specialize in salvaged property . This is most commonly seen in the cases of ships but could apply to other forms of recovery . While I am not sure of the legal interpretation , this clause might extend to the insurance company the right to claim any gain that an insured might have on property that was declared as a total loss , and then sold to a salvage company .

As time passed , however , the skyrocketing costs of long term care , coupled with longer lifespans created a situation where the insurers were more and more often taking losses on the policies . So they either retooled them , pushing the enrollment age up , lowering benefits , and raising the premiums , or they dropped the policies altogether .

{"input": "How To Reimburse Employees For Health Insurance? ", "output": "This has been a controversial area for several years as I presume you are asking about how to reimburse employees for the cost of individual health insurance . There had been a lot of activity which was embraced by a number of employers in past years to reimburse their employees for the cost of individual health insurance through the use of a Health Reimbursement Account -LRB- HRA -RRB- and making it a deductible business expense no different than an employer contribution to a group health insurance plan . In early 2013 the DOL and IRS issued statements that virtually every benefits professional recognized as being definitive in stating that this practice was not allowed . If an employer does not want to offer a group health insurance plan but wants to assist their employees in purchasing individual health insurance then the only practical way to do this appears to be by grossing up their pay by some amount . Of course , this is no different than giving the employees a pay raise from a tax perspective because that is exactly what you are doing . Also , this well intentioned action by the employer may have the unintended consequence of reducing or eliminating the amount of the Advanced Premium Tax subsidy that the employees might qualify for in the government health insurance marketplaces . But it is now clear than any employer support for employees purchasing their own health insurance can only be done on a post-tax basis . Depending upon a given group 's circumstances this may be a viable option to consider and is being done by some employers . This is an approach that needs to be handled with care and you should seek guidance regarding the applicability of this approach to your company 's specific situation .

In this situation , a deferred annuity would be suited for someone who wanted a guaranteed flow of income with no management responsibilities . A life annuity may or may not include a guaranteed payout . There are different options , so ask your insurance agent for details . In addition to the income amount , taxation during the the deferral period and of the income flow should be considered . In Canada , a deferred annuity can also refer to Guaranteed Investment Annuities -LRB- GIA -RRB- and Segregated Funds -LRB- variable annuities -RRB- . Both of these are issued by insurance companies and offer the option of an annuity in the future . Since they are issued by insurance companies , they also offer guarantees not offered by other institutions for non-registered investments . These include potential creditor protection and estate planning opportunities , such as bypassing probate . Segregated funds are similar to mutual funds , but they offer maturity and death guarantees . In addition , some segregated funds include the `` locking in '' of gains . Depending on your individual situation , there could also be some tax advantages to these plans . These type of deferred annuities are best suited for individuals who are looking for , and would benefit from , the additional features and guarantees . This is an overview of a potentially complex subject . If you would like to work with a local Retirement Planner , you could start with a Google search . For example if you search for , retirement planner Halifax or retirement planning Halifax , my name along with several others will come up . It will be the same in your community .

Unless we are fortunate enough to have a partner who makes enough to support our lifestyles , most of us would undergo substantial hardship by losing our source of income due to a disability . Even short term disabilities can quickly deplete the reserves some of us have stashed away for emergencies . Long Term or permanent disabilities can be devastating to even high income earners . Having Disability Insurance does not provide you with 100 % of your original salary , but can replace approx 70 % of it so that you at least have some time to regroup and evaluate your employment and lifestyle situation .

{"input": "When Do I Enroll In Medicare? ", "output": "You enroll in Medicare when you decide to retire and/or if your employer tells you they will not cover you on their group plan after age 65 . When you turn 65 you automatically get Part A . If you will remain on a company group plan then it 's best to postpone Part B until you decide to retire . If your benefits department tells you they do not offer benefits once you turn 65 then you would get both Medicare Part A & B . You should also look into a Medicare Supplement Plan at the same time because Part A & B only will cover about 80 % . You can start reviewing your options 6 months out so you will have plenty of time to make a decision . Medicare along with a Medicare Supplement Plan is actually great insurance . Most people find that the benefits are equal to or greater than what you had with your company group plan .

{"input": "I'm 50 with a term life policy that expires when I'm 60. Should I convert to whole life, and if so, when? ", "output": "If the only conversion option your policy offers is Whole Life , the rate is probably going to be quite a bit higher than if you take out a new , no lapse , Universal Life policy . However , when you convert Term Life , you are rated the same on your Whole Life that you were rated on your Term policy . So if your health has declined , you may be getting a good deal by converting . If it has not declined , I personally would check out a new policy to see how much you can save . As to when to convert , it depends on several factors . 1 . HOW MUCH you want to convert . If you want to convert it all , it may be a good idea to do it now , while rates are lower . They will go up quite a bit over the next 10 years . 2 . YOUR HEALTH . If you have very poor health , you may just want to pay those low Term rates another 10 years . If you have excellent health , it might be a good time to convert or look at what else you can get in a permanent policy . 3 . WILL YOU NEED LIFE INSURANCE after age 60 ? By the time you are 60 you should have a good idea of whether you will need that much coverage . You have some time to get a feel for how your retirement is going to pan out before you make this big decision . You can not reverse it and go back to Term , once you have converted your policy .

Insurance companies often have limitations as to the type of policy you can convert to and you need to find out exactly what type of policy they would allow you to convert to and make sure it fits your needs .

If conversion makes sense for you , I would do it sooner than later , especially if your current carrier allows conversion into any of their current permanent products . If not , and your health is acceptable , consider purchase of a permanent product from another company .

{"input": "When Does Life Insurance End? ", "output": "Term Life Insurance ends when you quit paying on it .

After the one month grace period is over , you must prove your health qiualifies to have the policy reinstated . If the level part of a Term policy is over -LRB- e.g. you are entering year 11 of a 10 year Term policy -RRB- , the policy will either automatically renew at an extremely high price , or the company will send you a letter telling you the new higher price and you must choose if you want it to renew at that price . From then on , the premium can go up annually . Most people do quit paying their Term Life Insurance and let it end at that point . Whole or Universal Life can be `` paid up '' for life , in which case all the premiums have been made and the policy will not end -LRB- as long as it was properly set up , there are no unpaid loans , etc -RRB- .

The Form HO-4 covers Personal Property and Personal Liability Insurance for the tenant -LRB- insured -RRB- .

One valuable example is if there is fire , smoke or water damage to the rented home or apartment unit , the property owner 's insurance company will most likely attempt to collect damages from the tenant if they can prove negligence . In this case , Renters Insurance will provide the legal representation to handle the situation although the policy limit will apply . If you are not sure and do n't really want to commit to purchase renters insurance but may or may not be required to according to your lease agreement , the best way to generate the lowest annual premium is to select the minimum personal property coverage available , the lowest limit of personal liability and the highest available deductible for the policy .

The Travelers tenant homeowners policy covers your personal property but limits that coverage to specific named perils . In my opinion , an excellent tenant homeowners policy would cover any direct damage -LRB- except for specific exclusions and limitations -RRB- . The basic Travelers tenants policy covers the insured for the Actual Cash Value of their property . An excellent policy would cover the full replacement cost of covered property , new for old . The Travelers tenant homeowners policy , like many others , covers your personal property but limits theft coverage on Jewelry , Furs or Silver to , I believe , $ 1000 . An excellent policy would have either no limitations or the limits would be no less than $ 5000 in the aggregate for each category . The Travelers liability coverage excludes , as do most other tenants policies , property damage to property in the insureds care , custody or control . Generally that would include property damage to the apartment you are living in . This exclusion would not apply to Fire or Smoke damage but I dont believe water damage to the apartment you rent would be covered by the basic policy . Securing coverage for accidental damage to the apartment they are living in may be a very important coverage for most apartment renters . Obtaining a waiver from your landlord for any damage covered by the landlords insurance may be the best and most economical alternative . If buying coverage on-line or face to face from a local broker , I suggest these questions be raised and addressed . "}

{"input": "Why Do Employers Offer Life Insurance? ", "output": "Employers providing some life insurance for their employees goes back well over a century when working conditions were often more hazardous and the workforce was overwhelmingly male . The death of an employee who was often the sole bread winner for his family would leave the spouse and/or children saddled with funeral expenses and a loss of income . Such situations were often viewed as harming the morale of other employees and reducing productivity as co-workers would often be taking time to raise money to assist the family of their late co-worker . It was also not uncommon for the family of the deceased employee to turn to the former employer requesting financial assistance which obviously put the employer in an uncomfortable situation . Term life insurance was an inexpensive way for the employer to address this employee need while enhancing employee loyalty and morale and avoiding workplace disruption . Since then the provision of employee life insurance became institutionalized as employee benefit plans became the norm . In fact , for many years it was not uncommon industry practice for the group 's health insurance carrier to require the bundled sale of some term life insurance when they implemented coverage for an employer group -LRB- a practice that has since been discontinued -RRB- . As such , employer 's providing life insurance for their employees has been a mix of employer 's looking out for their employees and their families , protecting their own self-interests , tradition and industry practices .

{"input": "Why Are Life Insurance Claims Denied? ", "output": "In addition to the excellent explanations offered by the other agents on this page , life insurance claims are sometimes denied due to the nature of the policy . If you purchase a graded policy , it will pay a reduced benefit for death due to natural causes during the first 1-4 years . With that type of policy , death due to accident will usually pay 100 % from day one . Sometimes accidental death is actually caused by a health condition -LRB- e.g. heart attack while driving a car -RRB- . When the claim is denied , it can come as a surprise because survivors were not aware that the policy was a graded during the first two years , and/or that the root cause of death was determined to be natural vs accidental . The same is true for people who think they are buying life insurance , when they are actually buying accidental death insurance . You need to be very careful about what type of policy you are getting so that your claim is not denied simply because you purchased the wrong type of policy . A final , common reason for denial of claims is late premium payments . In our office , we spend a lot of time each week reminding people whose policies have entered the grace period , that they need to pay their premium or lose their coverage . But many agencies due not send reminders , and it is easy to lose track of addresses , phone numbers , and email address of clients because people change those frequently in today 's society . At the very least , keep your address up to date with the insurance company so that you will receive any late notices and keep your policy in force for the time of need . "}

Other situations where there may be a payout may be denied is if death occurred form an act of war or there was an exclusion rider on the policy -LRB- e.g. aviation exclusion for recreational pilots -RRB- .

Or if death is by suicide the claim will be denied if within 2 years -LRB- In Canada -RRB- If the policy is over 2 years old the insurance company has to prove fraud which is difficult to prove .

{"input": "Why Is Universal Life Insurance Bad? ", "output": "Every insurance plan available in the market serves a purpose so you ca n't really say one is `` bad , '' each type of plan just has to be used in the right way . Certain programs are designed to meet certain needs . You 're not going to find one plan that meets every possible need you can think of . Universal life and whole life are two types of permanent life insurance - universal life has a lot of advantages to it that you wont find in whole life . One of the major parts of permanent programs to remember is cash value . However , many individuals do not realize that when the insured dies , the carrier takes back the cash value and pays out the death benefit . Whole life is generally going to be much more expensive than Universal life because of the guarantees inside the policy . Whole life can be a great tool for retirement planning , providing coverage for new borns , and other financial planning when you 're buying in your younger years , but can be very expensive in your older years . Universal life does not provide the same levels of guarantees inside the policy with regards to the cash value . The trade-off is the ability to secure lower premiums for the same amount of coverage and create flexible premiums . Whole life has been around for decades and decades . When universal life was first introduced into the marketplace -LRB- I believe around the 1970s -RRB- , if the cash value dropped to $ 0 , your policy would crash and not provide you with coverage unless you paid more into it . Around the late 90s/early 2000s , carriers started introducing what 's called a `` no-lapse UL rider . '' In short , these riders said that if the cash value goes to $ 0 , but you keep paying your premiums , the policy will still provide the death benefit coverage . The majority of universal life policies today will have this rider , now commonly known as Guaranteed Universal Life -LRB- GUL -RRB- , and can be structured to keep the premiums and death benefits fixed and guaranteed for life or up to a specified age -LRB- e.g. to age 90 , to age 95 , to age 100 , etc. -RRB- . The idea being to maximize your death benefit without overpaying premiums . Contact an independent insurance agent/broker to learn more about these two products and which will be more suitable to your needs . If you 're buying strictly for the death benefit , you will likely want to look into a GUL policy . "}
{"input": "Why Is Universal Life Insurance Bad? ", "output": "Why is universal life insurance bad ? Hmmm . It all depends . Do you want the lowest possible rate for temporary coverage ? Maybe 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 years ? Buy some term insurance . Universal life will be more expensive . But of course , the renewal premium could be sky high . Do you want very significant cash accumulation , on both a guaranteed and a non - guaranteed basis ? Buy whole life insurance . Universal life probably wont give you the same numbers . But of course , you pay extra in premium for those guarantees . And it is a fixed-premium product , so you better keep paying . Then again , perhaps you want flexibility on the payment premium schedule . Perhaps you want to put in more money . Or maybe put in less money . Or maybe skip a payment . You can do all this with universal life insurance . Just make sure you know what you are doing so the policy still performs as expected . Maybe you want to lock in to a premium for the rest of your life and not have to worry about the price ever going up . But you dont want to pay an arm and a leg for the coverage . You could buy universal life insurance with a lifetime guarantee . You wont accumulate much cash , but hey , you will have saved a ton of money in premium , as compared to whole life . Lets say you have a chronic medical condition which could pose a higher mortality risk . But you still want to save money on the cost . Perhaps an insurance company will give you a concession on the price ? Could they do that with term insurance ? No . Could they do that with whole life insurance ? No .

Term and whole life policies are very simple , straight forward policies . You pay a set premium , at set times , and the end date is clearly defined as the end of the term , or when you pass . Universal policies are not so clear , and often lead to trouble for the buyer , if they are not clearly shown what has to happen for this type of policy to work .

The members of the group therefore have an insurable interest in them , and deserve money to compensate for their loss . And this could include people with many other impairments . Autism , depression , severe anxiety , PTSD . ADD . OCD . People with any and all of these can be fairly high functioning , and therefore insurable . Dont forget one other important item : planning for people with special needs . Folks with impairments can be functional , but can also remain dependent on their family members . What if those family members die ? Life insurance is needed on on the parents , or responsible siblings , so that the dependent family member can remain self-sufficient . Now , with regard to the choice of carrier : there is not a hot list of companies that take people with mental illness . Potential applicants need to be prequalified to identify the carrier with the most interest in this particular case at this particular time . And that could change from quarter to quarter , or from year-to-year . It is the job of the broker to know which companies like which types of cases . "}

{"input": "What Happens When My Term Life Insurance Ends? ", "output": "What happens when your term life insurance ends ? What will happen is this : you will take out your checkbook , remember what your premium used to be , breathe heavy sigh , and then make your check payable for a much larger amount . In my career I have seen renewal premiums literally 10 times the original rate . Yes , 10 times . Doesnt always happen , but it does happen . And you will not know how high the increase will be until you get your renewal notice . They dont tell you in advance . Why would an insurance company slam you on the renewal ? Several factors could be involved . One is that they are a little bit concerned about their reserves . They need to bulk up . Another could be that they feel the credit market is a little bit tight . So they need to store up some money in case they cant go out and get enough new money . Perhaps they feel the whole block of term business is not profitable . Maybe there is a big fat insurance company lurking in the wings ready to buy them , and they consider the term business to be a liability . So they will jack up the rates to get rid of a lot of policies . -LRB- To tell you the truth , I need to learn a little bit more about this last reason myself . Most people keep paying term premiums , dont die , and then drop their policies anyway . So the insurance company has received a bunch of money without paying any out . Why not keep the renewal rates more reasonable to hold onto these customers ? -RRB- But the net result of these high renewals is that the only people who hold on to their policies are people who really need the coverage , and feel they have no other option . They feel that their medical history or lifestyle risks would make them ineligible for coverage , or make a new policy too expensive . The fact of the matter , though , is that they may indeed qualify for a better rate elsewhere . They should get prequalified and really see what the market has to offer . They may very well be surprised . And if they dont get a better deal , then the term conversion rider in their policy may be an option . As long as they are not over the maximum conversion age , they could lock into permanent rates . And they dont have to convert the entire face amount at once : it could be done in stages , to better manage cash flow . Thanks for asking . Want to learn more ? Review my blog at planrisklive.com .

{"input": "Why Would You Buy Life Insurance For A Baby? ", "output": "There are a couple reasons parents would buy life insurance on their baby . For one a true whole life insurance policy accumulates cash value which could be used to help out in life events such as college or a wedding . It also guarantees the insurability of the child . For example , one of my co-workers purchased life insurance on his young son who developed diabetes at age 13 . If he had not done so , his son would have a hard time finding a company who would insure him . "}
{"input": "Why Would You Buy Life Insurance For A Baby? ", "output": "This question has several answers . From a financial planning perspective , the answer is thatyou would n't . The adverse financial impact of the death of a child is relatively small . While a terrible tragedy and an absolutely awful thing to go through , technically no one financially depends on them for support . So , one of the basic tenets of life insurance - to provide lost income due to premature death of a family bread-winner - buying life insurance on a child does not make sense . While children might not need life insurance , here are some reasons why one might want to buy it on them anyway : 1 . Insure the child 's insurability - this can be achieved by purchasing a small face amount of permanent life insurance -LRB- I would recommend participating whole life -RRB- with a guaranteed future purchase option rider . The rider insures that the insured can purchase additional life insurance without the need to medically qualify . If the adult child 's health goes south , additional life insurance can be purchased . Drawbacks : a -RRB- the option usually runs out at 40 or so years old ; b -RRB- typically , only the same type of life insurance can be purchased -LRB- which can be a lot more expensive at age 30 than at age 3 -RRB- , and c -RRB- if you do n't exercise the option , you lose it . Oh , and by the way , the insured usually assumes ownership of the policy at 18 , at which time , that income-tax-free cash value can be mighty handy for the down payment on that new car . So long , insurance policy , we hardly got to know you . 2 . Provide a source of money with tax-favored access privileges - This is n't likely to work -LRB- see `` new car '' above -RRB- , but if protected by a trust with strict limits on how the cash values may be used and under what conditions it must be paid back , it could allowa responsibleadult child to be his/her own bank and/or have at least somewhere to go , independently , to cover an emergency need . The problem is that even a trust can be gotten around and the cash - and the life insurance benefit it supports - is more likely to end up being spent - and lapsed . 3 . If one feels that the death of a child could seriously impact them financially , I recommend purchasing a child rider -LRB- usually comes in `` units '' , 1 unit = $ 1000 coverage -RRB- on a parent 's term or permanent policy . Twenty-five to fifty-units should be plenty to cover final expenses and maybe some medical bills not covered by medical insurance . Using life insurance to help fund college is not the best use of the money spent over the years . There are now too many other tax-favored savings vehicles that do n't include the cost of insurance to depend on a life policy to provide a significant amount of cash over a 16 or 17 year investment horizon . In the event of the death of one child , the insurance money received as a death benefit could go to help provide some start-up college money for another child in the family -LRB- # 3 would be the least expensive way for that to happen -RRB- , but that 's kind of creepy . I think # 1 is the only prudent reason to buy insurance on a child and then only when there is a family history of childhood or adult onset of some kind of genetic malady like diabetes or cardiac problems . Otherwise , # 3 might make you feel better , but it 's not likely to be needed . "}
{"input": "Why Would You Buy Life Insurance For A Baby? ", "output": "There are many reasons that you would want to get a life insurance policy for a baby . First of all to guarantee insurability for the little one . To get the policy issued at the lowest rate possible for a second .

Most insurance companies offer `` Level Term '' riders that may be added to the parents policies that will allow the parent to insure all of his or her current and future children . These riders also guarantee the insurability of the children as they are usually convertable to their own private policy 's when they reach either age 21 or 25 . sometimes the insurance company will allow the child to change his or her policy 's face amount up to 5 times the amount of the original rider without evidence of insurability . The best thing about these riders is the price , whether you have one child or 20 children you can insure them all for one low price under this rider . If you are an insurance agent please do not forget to offer this rider to the parents that you are insuring . "}

Keep in mind that companies will generally require that you the parent have Life Insurance on yourself first . Insurance Companies look at this as `` who is depending on the baby for support ?

First of all , you pay a much higher premium for the return of premium guarantee . That makes sense . After all , you are not only asking the carrier to guarantee your premium for a specified amount of years - you are asking them to guarantee your money back as well . You have to pay for that extra layer of insurance . Is the extra amount you pay competitive ? Depends . What if you are a savvy investor and know how to get some good value for your dollar ?

Get a camera and take a picture of every room to include closets and dressers . Dispassionately list the things that you see in the photos that are your property .

The other thing I want to point out is that the liability coverage inthe renters policy like the liability section of homeowners in general is very competitivelypriced . Do n't skimp here .

{"input": "How Can I Make Sure That I Don't Run Out Of Money In Retirement? ", "output": "There are two issues involved in determining the likelihood of running out of money . The first is the amount of money you have accumulated to help provide retirement income and the second is the rate at which you spend that money . The return on the accumulation is important however without sufficient capital and a reasonable rate of withdrawal your retirement nest egg can be exhausted at some point . Retirement could last a very long time . Some will be retired longer than the period of time that they work . With improving health and medical treatment for diseases that have shortened the lives of those before us , you could be looking at a retirement of more than thirty years . Retirement may start unexpectedly . Waiting to start accumulating money for retirement can be hazardous . Almost forty percent of retirees report that there retirement started because of circumstances beyond their control . Losing a job after age 50 could trigger retirement as could the disability of a spouse or parent . Moving capital from your current income stream is critical to develop a retirement fund . As crucial as returns can be , unless there is a movement of capital there isnt anything for those results to work with . If you are employed you should certainly understand your employers pension plan if one is offered . Under normal circumstances the company pension plan will provide the greatest opportunity to shift capital into a retirement fund . If you are the employer there are some opportunities for you to provide for your retirement . Many of these are complicated and require expert assistance . The bottom line is that you do have opportunities . Individuals can also establish Individual Retirement Accounts -LRB- IRA . -RRB- This also applies to spouses that are not gainfully employed . The contribution is limited but if started early enough can make a significant contribution to the movement of capital into your retirement fund . You might have heard of a Roth IRA and that too can become an important part of your retirement fund but it has different rules and you should consult with a tax consultant and a Retirement Income professional about that . The second half of the issue is the way that money is withdrawn from your retirement account . This whole subject is really complex and involves a lot of decisions but the basic thing is to understand the need for a budget . Without a budget you can not set a withdrawal rate and you can not know how long your retirement fund will last . Most Americans resist budgeting but it is something that can be started easily and can be started even today . While you might not be retired you can start to record your expenses . The longer you do this the better handle you will have on your spending . The more detail you use in your record keeping the more your budget projections will increase in accuracy . There are assets that most people do not consider as they come into retirement . The first is their ability to work . If there is something that you enjoy and are good at you should prepare to move into that activity when you retire and with some planning that can be an income producing activity . This can be anything from consulting to a hobby that you love and from which you are able to earn money . Some people write some take photographs ; others sell hand made products at trade fairs . These types of activities can enhance your retirement fund by reducing the need for immediate income . There are , of course many other issues to consider such as housing , long term care and legacy goals but if you can get these two principles started you will be well on your way to providing a satisfactory and predictable retirement .

You are definitely not the only one asking that question , or losing sleep worrying about it , I promise you . There are a few ways that you may want to consider .

Wise timing for taking your Social Security benefits can help also - the later you take them , the higher the benefit amount . Investing in an IRA , like a Roth , can also help provide a source of income - Roth 's are good , because you are n't required to start withdrawals from them , so you can let them grow for as long as you can before tapping into them . Start investing and saving early ; reduce whatever debt that you will be heading into retirement with ; and have a solid idea of what retirement looks like to you , so you know how much you will need to have put away to make that retirement vision a reality .

{"input": "Can You Negotiate Life Insurance Rates? ", "output": "No , life insurance rates are non-negotiable to the extent that you can not ask for a discount . Likewise , all agents must charge the same rates . When you see an agency advertising affordable rates , what we mean is that we can shop multiple companies to place you with the one that is most favorable for your health and age . When you see an agency broadcasting extremely low prices for life insurance , what they are doing is quoting the best rate for the shortest term . Most brokers have access to those same companies and rates , and applying with one agency over another will not cause you to qualify for a discount . What does matter in life insurance rates is matching up with an agency who understands your situation and can help your policy be placed at the best possible rate . This starts with putting your application with the right company , and it ends with seeing that policy through to the end . If your doctor has retired and moved to the Bahamas and no one can find the medical records required to get your policy approved , this agency will track them down or work with the underwriter to get you approved without them .

{"input": "What Does HMO Health Insurance Cover? ", "output": "HMO 's cover the same medical services that traditional major medical insurance plans , either group or individual cover . The essential difference is in the provider network used to deliver these benefits and how the subscriber 's access to their benefits is guided by this approach . HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization and while there are variations on the theme , in its purest form an HMO has an exclusive network of contracted providers that must be used by subscribers to the HMO in order to receive covered services . In this context an HMO would not pay for services a member receives from a non-HMO provider . Also , HMO 's often use a `` gatekeeper '' approach that requires a referral from a Primary Care Physician before the member can receive care from a specialist or other HMO provider for non-emergency services . Theoretically the HMO concept assures that your Primary Care Physician is overseeing the member 's complete range of health care services and treatment , makes sure that care is being delivered in the most appropriate and cost effective setting and manner , and maximizes the overall efficiency of the delivery of health care to its members . In practical terms the HMO concept has generally fared best in higher population density areas that have an extensive and competitive medical infrastructure in place . One of the main reasons for this is that the HMO providers can actually be employees of the HMO or have negotiated deep discounts for their services with the HMO in exchange for a high volume of patient traffic . Accomplishing this in a metropolitan area like Los Angeles is far easier than in a rural area where there may be not be many competing providers and hospitals and these providersare already serving virtually all of the area 's population . Also , the more restrictive and controlling nature of the HMO concept has not always been welcomed by the American consumer who has been accustomed to making their own choices when it comes to selecting their doctors , hospitals and pharmacies and having a high degree of freedom in when and where they access the health care system . While HMOs can deliver excellent benefits and services at attractive rates , the potential consumer should also consider the trade offs involved in achieving these ends . If the consumer finds the HMO network to be sufficient for their perceived needs and understands therules of being an HMO member it can be a very positive environment in which to receive one 's health care . Going into an HMO without understanding and accepting these factors can lead to a very unsatisfactory and perhaps costly experience . "}

{"input": "Which Home Insurance Is Best In California? ", "output": "When this question is asked I am not sure if you mean the best insurance company with coverage 's and claims or the who has the best rates . Let 's address rates first : There is no company who has the best rates as there are many varying factors that can make one insurance company rise to the top over another as it pertains to premium . In other words who has the best rate for me may not be the best for you , and we could live right next door to each other . Now lets move on to the more important issue and that is coverage 's : What you have to understand is most insurance companies have varying options/packages of coverage 's available to purchase . In most cases agents tend to offer the cheapest package which does not maximize coverage 's that are potentially available to the client . I suggest when shopping for insurance that you truly consult with your agent about the different options available by an insurance company so you can make an educated decision on the coverage you wish to purchase and how much of the risk you yourself wish to assume . As an independent agent I am able to offer quotes and coverage 's from multiple companies to help my clients make the most informed decision about their most important asset , and that is their home . Now the next subject would be claims : Which insurance company continues to rise to the top in claims handling . There are many independent websites which you do a quick search on and find ratings on how well claims are handled and their overall customer satisfaction and loyalty . There are many companies that are great in the claims area that I bet you have never even heard of . You will also find negatives on every insurance company out there without exception . Most of the negatives are due to coverage 's not being in place that the client thought they had . Or in other words . A lack of understanding their policy . This goes back to my suggestion on being educated on the coverage 's available to you . There are many independent online reviews available to you -LRB- some good , some not so good -RRB- that will give you ratings on how well the claims experience is for clients and how insurance companies rank in the claims department . But there is one thing that I believe is very critical to the claims process and that is your agent . An absentee agent can make the process very frustrating if you are having some communication difficulty with the insurance company . An agent that is actually working for you can help make any unfortunate claims experience must less painful then it needs to be . So never take the agent out of the equation when shopping for homeowners insurance . So with all that being said , my parting advice is do your research , consult and ask lots of questions from your agent . Do n't be shy are think it 's a dumb question because it 's not . After all , were talking about your home . "}

{"input": "Why Is Car Insurance Expensive For Young Drivers? ", "output": "The short answer is that younger and more inexperienced drivers are far more likely to have an accident .

It isnt that someone has an axe to grind against young drivers . Young drivers simply cost the company more to insure . "}

{"input": "What Does Elimination Period Mean For Disability Insurance? ", "output": "The elimination period is chosen at the time of application for the DI policy and represents a kind of `` time deductible '' that must be fulfilled before a claim is paid . The clock starts ticking when the carrier is informed in writing by a medical professional that the insured person has suffered a debilitating accident , developed a medical condition , or contracted a serious illness that is likely to last longer than the elimination period chosen . Thefirst dayof fulfillment of the elimination period typically begins at the date-of-onset of the debilitating event , although that actual date-of-onset is subject to the decision of the insurance company after reviewing medical records . Claims , i.e. a check for the maximum monthly benefit for income replacement , would usually not arrive until 30 days after the completion of the elimination period . For example , say the injured or sick insured has a 90-day elimination period . The income replacement check would arrive 30 days later , or 120 days from the date-of-onset . In the meantime , the insured would be responsible for paying bills during that four month period . So , serious discussion needs to take place at application time about how long of an elimination period should be applied for understanding that reality . The insured shouldmake sure that a liquid asset account be available at all times for such expenses , and/or a short-term DI policy should be in place , and/or a sufficient amount of sick leave and vacation be saved up , or a combination of all those accommodations .

{"input": "How To Compare Home Insurance? ", "output": "The traditional way to compare home policies is to take the declarations page to another agent and ask for a comparison .

{"input": "For The Sake Of Privacy, Can A Dependent Apply For A 2nd Health Insurance? ", "output": "You get the award for the interesting question of the day . I assume you are a dependent over age 18 to begin with but are still covered under your parents health insurance plan . If you have the financial ability to pay for your own health insurance then technically you can purchase your own coverage . However , a standard part of any insurance application is a section that asks you if you will have any other health insurance coverage in effect at the same time that you will have the policy you are applying for . This is so the insurance carrier you are applying with can coordinate their coverage with the other insurance plan you are covered under . A person can be double covered -LRB- increasingly rare these days -RRB- but you can not make a profit from being insured which would technically be feasible if you filed the same claim independently with each carrier and each insurance carrier was unaware of the other 's coverage of the claim . To notanswer this question honestlywould be toengage in fraud , which could result in claim denial and possible civil liability if the double coverage situation was uncovered . The odds are pretty good that as the claim went through the national data bases that the double coverage situation would be uncovered , it might take some time but it would probably eventually surface . Answering the question honestly , will result in your insurance carrier initiating a coordination of benefits process with your parents insurance carrier in the event of a claim . This would almost certainly result in them receiving some notification from their insurance carrier of this coordination of benefits activity and them becoming aware of the situation . While I understand everyone 's desire for privacy , as a parent myself , I would certainly want to be aware of any health care that my dependent children are receiving , especially when the parent to some extent or another is going to be paying part of the bill either as part of their basic premiums and quite likely as part of deductible and/or copay financial exposure . In essence hiding a separate insurance coverage and medical care from your parents will be very difficult to do and presents you with ethical issues you must be prepared to deal with . If you want total privacy from your parentsin these matters then you must be prepared to tell your parents you no longer want to be covered as a dependent and purchase your own coverage for which you are financially responsible .

A business that would suffer financially from the death of a partner or key employee . Life insurance is the most affordable way to cover these financial losses due to an unexpected or sudden death .

{"input": "What Are The Coverage Characteristics Of Life Insurance? ", "output": "All life insurance falls into one of two categories of coverage . Each category has certain characteristics that make it more suitable for certain needs . Term life insurance is for temporary protection needs . If the insured dies during the term period , the insurer pays a death benefit . If the insured survives the coverage period , coverage ends . Permanent or cash value life insurance is for permanent protection needs lasting one 's lifetime . It provides coverage for life and , provided the premiums are paid and the policy does not lapse , a death benefit will always be paid . Cash values build over time and can be withdrawn or borrowed if needed . Term usually expires before you do while permanent is designed to last for your lifetime . "}
{"input": "Why Would You Be Turned Down For Life Insurance?

There are a number of insurers for example that will insure people up the the age of 90 ... not very many , but there are a few . Most will not insure people over the age of 80 no matter how good their health is . The mortality tables just place them at the high end of risk for death and therefore not a good investment for the insurance company . Most health conditions are not complete blocks to getting insurance , but may well be rated and therefore require a higher premium . Most insurers will not insure a convicted felon until they have fulfilled their parole requirements . Even then some companies will not take the risk . If a person 's occupation and or avocation is considered too high a risk , that may cause some insurance companies to decline issuing a policy . "}

Because of this risk their underwriters will look at very aspect of your life starting withage , build , occupation , life style , health status , geography , drug use and nicotine use to determine this risk . If any one of the aspects is outside of their risk tolerance then the person is declined for life insurance . "}
{"input": "What Is Fixed In A Fixed Annuity? ", "output": "The word fixed has to do with the rate of return . The insurance company exchanges a fixed amount of money , paid either in one payment or in periodic payments and agrees to make regular fixed payments for the lifetime of the annuitant starting at a specific date or a date to be selected later . In this case the insurance company assumes the entire risk for both earnings and principal "}

{"input": "What Are Life Insurance Quotes? ", "output": "Life insurance quotes are an estimation of the premiums you would pay for a given life insurance coverage structure -LRB- face amount and term length -RRB- . However , a quote is only as good as the information it 's based on . So if you run a quote at the most preferred rates and have n't factored in your height/weight , medications used , medical conditions , family medical history , tobacco usage , driving history issues , participation in extreme/hazardous activities , and a number of other factors , then the quote figures you ran are pretty much useless as they do not represent an accurate picture for the proposed coverage . The risk classification is the MOST IMPORTANT part of any quote an insurance agent gives you because the risk classification determines the premiums for the coverage . The final risk class a carrier approves you at after underwriting your policy will tell you what premiums the carrier will require for the coverage to be active . Many individuals like to see quotes with the most preferred rates -LRB- preferred plus risk class -RRB- as they are the cheapest cost and then they end up thinking that 's what they should get -LRB- and if they do n't get it , then they will forget the entire process and not even bother securing any coverage at all -RRB- . What you apply for is not always what you get - not everyone qualifies for the best rates . For example , if you have a major medical condition -LRB- e.g. heart attack , diabetic , had cancer , etc. -RRB- and the quote that was ran was for a preferred plus risk class , you 're wasting your time applying for it because every carrier is going to offer a higher risk class -LRB- and therefore require higher premiums -RRB- for the coverage -LRB- or possibly decline or postpone you for coverage depending on the details of the medical history -RRB- . This is why it 's critical to work with an experienced , knowledgeable , independent life insurance broker who knows the right questions to ask and can shop the case among multiple companies so they can give you the most accurate quotes up front that represent a realistic expectation of what you can expect to pay for the desired life insurance program . An important note : You NEVER want to just apply to a bunch of companies to see what sticks as this actually works against you because it 's a red flag to insurance companies when they complete the MIB check during underwriting -LRB- Medical Information Bureau - every carrier checks this because if you were declined by other companies , they want to know why -RRB- . You want to have your best -LRB- and most accurate -RRB- estimate up front so you get it right the first time so you can get the best rates for your program . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your coverage and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much . "}

{"input": "What Should Life Insurance Cost? ", "output": "My guess is that the answer to that question , `` What Should Life Insurance Cost ? '' will be different from every insurance agent you ask . Of course it depends on the type of life insurance and who the insured is , their gender , age , and health . It also depends on the face amount of the policy and if it 's a Term policy - how long is the term . The thing is that while the insurance industry is highly regulated and the insurance providers have to justify their costs in order to have their premiums approved , there is definitely a good deal of variance in what the different providers charge for similar coverage . You need to realize that the insurance company is taking all the risk , and that 100 % of all clients will eventually die and therefore a claim made on their policies . So what life insurance should cost is the amount needed to cover the insurer 's costs to provide the insurance plus enough profit for the company in order to insure that they will continue in business and be able to pay the benefit upon claim .

If you have a business loan that you will pay off over the next 10 years , 10 year Term Life Insurance may be your best choice . However , if you do n't have a set need , getting a policy that will last until the date that the policy can last be converted can be a good choice . E.g. Let 's say you are 40 and the policy is convertible to the end of the term or age 70 , whichever comes first . If you get a 30 year term policy , you will have inexpensive coverage for the next 30 years . Perhaps you no longer need life insurance at age 70 , so you can just drop your coverage when the term ends . On the other hand , you may develop a serious illness and not want to lose your policy . Converting your current term policy to a permanent one can be a wonderful option to have in this situation . "}
{"input": "What Is 20 Year Term Life Insurance?

A 20 year term policy usually stays the same price for 20 years , although you need to check the years that the premium is guaranteed to be sure it can not go up in price during that time . When the 20 years are up , the policy will end or the price will increase drastically . "}
{"input": "How Long Has Long Term Care Insurance Been Around? ", "output": "Long term care insurance is a relatively new form of insurance . It has been around since the early 1970s . In those early days , it was primarily seen as `` nursing home '' insurance that provided indemnity benefits . Indemnity policies pay a specified amount for each day of covered services regardless of the actual costs incurred by the insured . It has evolved beyond this limited beginning to reimburse the insured for costs he or she incurs for comprehensive covered services in one 's home or in a nursing home or assisted living facilities up to a daily , weekly or monthly maximum stated by the policy .

{"input": "Should I Buy Long Term Care Insurance In My 40s? ", "output": "Long-term care insurance is kind of like life insurance in the way that you should purchase it as early as possible . If you wait until your health is bad you may not qualify for the insurance . And , none of us know when our health will start going downhill . People might become uninsurable due to sudden and unforeseen events . Do you purchase automobile insurance after an accident ? Do you purchase homeowners insurance after your house burns ?

{"input": "Should I Buy Long Term Care Insurance In My 40s? ", "output": "I personally never recommend long term care insurance until a person is at least mid 50s to early 60s .

{"input": "Should I Buy Long Term Care Insurance In My 40s? ", "output": "If it 's affordable and makes sense as part of your financial plan . As you look at various companies that sell LTCi , make sure you only purchase what you believe is necessary in terms of how long the policy will last once you need care . Another and most important consideration is the cost of living rider . I would purchase this with the highest benefit accumulation .

For instance there are permanent life policies that have long term riders as well as annuities which provide a much higher payout if you need care . "}

{"input": "Is State Farm a good company for Life Insurance? ", "output": "Well to join the love fest . I agree with Tyler and Scott . While State Farm is a highly rated company and does a good job on the Home and Auto side . Their life insurance offerings are just not competitive . As Scott said they really push their non guaranteed Universal Life and may add term to boost the face amount . Their underwriting is yet another issue . Being primarily a property and casualty company they have stricter Life Insurance underwriting than a Life Insurance company . Many times the agent is not that involved in the sale or service which may be relegated to the customer service rep. I have been a licensed agent for a long time . I use a property and casualty company for my property and casualty coverages and Life Insurance companies for my Life Insurance . "}
{"input": "Is State Farm a good company for Life Insurance? ", "output": "I agree with what Tyler said . As a rule , most property and casualty companies -LRB- that mainly sell auto , homeowners and business insurance -RRB- are worth looking at but definitely not the ONLY place you want to look for life insurance . State Farm is a top rated insurance company and is a brand you should consider in your research . A wise consumer should always shop all insurance purchases against dozens of other companies before making a purchase . If the savings are substantial , I would buy elsewhere . If the price is close ... State Farm is fine . An independent insurance broker can help you shop dozens of companies all at one time . "}
{"input": "Is State Farm a good company for Life Insurance? ", "output": "State Farm is a perfectly fine company with strong financial ratings . But , their Life Insurance is not what most agents would define as competitive . In fact , it often tends to be more expensive when compared to other companies . State Farm -LRB- and Allstate -RRB- often offer to discount your Home or Auto if you place your Life Insurance with them . On the surface it sounds like a great deal . But you need to actually compare the Home/Auto discount , to the difference in Premium for the more competitive Life Insurance Policy . Every time I have done this with a person , the lower priced Life Insurance Policy saves a lot more money than a discount other policies .

{"input": "Can Someone Have Two Health Insurance Policies? ", "output": "Technically , yes , you could . Though it would serve little practical purpose and be a really expensive proposition in this day and age . When you enroll in a health insurance plan there will always be a question asking if you will have other coverage in effect along with the policy you are applying for . This is so the two insurance carriers can coordinate their benefits among each other . In no case will your coverage with the combined insurance policies exceed 100 % of your covered expenses and it is illegal to make a profit off of having health insurance coverage . So , you would pay two full premiums for two separate major medical policies but , at best the secondary policy would only pay what was n't paid for by the primary policy . While I have n't seen or heard of it being tried , I would expect that a person enrolling for coverage through HealthCare.gov , especially a person who qualifies for a premium tax subsidy , would not be allowed to enroll in more than one plan by the way the computerized enrollment system is set up .

{"input": "When Do Companies Have To Offer Health Insurance?

In 2008 , the GAO released a report `` State Oversight of Rate Setting and Claims Settlement Practices '' involving 10 sample states on the topicand reported the following : `` Regulators in the 10 states GAO reviewed oversee claims settlement practices by monitoring consumer complaints and conducting examinations in an effort to ensure that companies are complying with standards . Claims settlement standards in these states largely focus on timely investigation and payment of claims and prompt communication with consumers , but the standards adopted and how states define timeliness vary notably across the states . Regulators told GAO that reviewing consumer complaints is one of the primary methods for monitoring companies compliance with state standards . In addition to monitoring complaints , these regulators also said that they use examinations of company practices to identify any violations in standards that may require further action . Finally , state regulators in 6 of the 10 states in GAOs review reported that their states are considering additional protections related to claims settlement . For example , regulators in several states said that their states were considering an independent review process for consumers appealing claims denials . Such an addition may be useful as some regulators said that they lack authority to resolve complaints where , for example , the company and consumer disagree on a factual matter , such as a consumers eligibility for benefits .

There policies are primarily supplemental , designed to pay in addition to any other coverage you may have .

{"input": "Does Aflac Offer Disability Insurance? ", "output": "Yes , AFLAC does have disability insurance in their portfolio of supplementary insurance products . Most commonly people are offered AFLAC coverage through their place of employment though consumers can go directly to AFLAC for coverage . There are two types of disability insurance ; Short Term and Long Term Disability . The general industry standard is that a short term disability plan pays benefits for up to 6-months and long term policies cover much longer periods of disability . AFLAC takes more of a hybrid approach in their disability product that gives an individual options that can extend beyond the time period normally associated with short term disability policies but at the same time not going as far as most long term disability policies will cover . Disability insurance can be very important as we have about a 1 out 3 chance of being disabled for some period during our working years . However , not all disability insurance policies are created equal or offer the same value propositions . The convenience of buying at the workplace and paying through payroll deduction can be very attractive , this is no guarantee though that it is really the best fit for your individual needs . If you are serious about insuring your paycheck you would be well served to explore both AFLAC and other options you can obtain in the marketplace . Also , just because your employer allows an AFLAC agent to come into your workplace and sell you insurance does n't mean that your employer has gone through any process of determining if these products are a good value for you . The reason is that you are paying for it with your money so it 's a `` let the buyer beware '' situation and is totally different than the process your employer goes through when looking for group health insurance for their employees . In that case the employer is financially involved and they go through an extensive shopping and comparison process before deciding on the best health insurance option to offer their employees . This is not to say that AFLAC does not have good products or that they have n't helped many customers over the years - they have . But , at the same time , massive advertising and branding campaigns combined with very aggressive sales tactics are no guarantee of being the best value . "}

Typically , it is an inexpensive policy and as such there really is not a lot of money in the commission nor expense factor of the company . What that means is that it is underwritten by class and one policy is not much different than the other . My recommendation to you is to start with your auto insurer . I frequently find the pricing of renters policy nearly all offset by the savings you get from having both with the same company .

Permanent life insurance programs have cash value building inside the policies - term insurance does not build cash value . There are two primary types of permanent coverage - universal and whole life . When the policyowner borrows from the cash value , he/she is creating a loan .

Most experts recommend 10x your annual income assuming you have debts or people depending upon that income .

Lets suppose you unfortunately have diabetes . Your broker would have to find you a company that is very competitive in underwriting diabetics . The same applies for people who have hepatitis , and a cancer history , and heart disease , and who climb mountains , and who scuba dive , etc. . Companies vary widely in their willingness and capability for taking on different risks at a good price . And this can change over time . The company that was good for people who are overweight last year , may not be the best one this year . Not only that : even a company who is usually good for your underwriting risk , may not be the right company for you at this time . Like every other business , life insurance companies can have ebbs and flows in their level of service . They may be short-staffed . They may be experiencing a huge backlog of cases . There may be a merger or an acquisition in the wind which will affect their underwriting decisions . Then again , there could be factors that would work in your favor . A company may want to close out the year with an influx of good business , and make you an exceptional offer .

{"input": "Can I Borrow Against My Life Insurance? ", "output": "When taking money from a Life Insurance Policy you need to consider the impact on your policy when you take a withdrawal or a loan . Both are available within your policy providing you have the cash value available . A withdrawal is taking money out of the cash value , with no intention of putting it back into the policy . The death benefit will be reduced in most cases as well as the remaining cash value . As long as the withdrawal is less than the money you have paid into the policy , there should not be a taxable event . If you do exceed the money you have paid in , then you will have to pay taxes on the amount over . On the other hand , a loan is a great option especially if you want to pay back the money taken . Look at your policy to understand the loan provisions . There is a fixed rate and most likely a variable rate . Depending how the policy credits money , and what the expected future growth might be , will determine which loan option may work best . Sometimes clients will take a withdrawal up to the cost basis , the premium you have paid in , then switch to a loan to minimize any tax burden .

The most common is a term policy which will last for a set number of years . 10 , 20 , 30 ... but then they expire and the cost of getting a whole life policy then is more expensive since the premiums go by age . I have a 20yr paid up policy on my children for $ 10k death benefit . I pay a very low amount for 20 years and they will have $ 10,000 coverage for the rest of their lives .

{"input": "What exactly is flexible premium survivorship adjustable life insurance? ", "output": "This is more commonly known as a survivorship universal life -LRB- SUL -RRB- insurance policy - it 's different from an individual universal life insurance policy in that the policy insures the lives of two people -LRB- usually a husband and wife -RRB- . The policy proceeds are only paid out upon the death of the second insured . Many people use this type of policy for estate planning purposes . If your mother can not continue to make premium payments or does not want to , she can surrender the policy and take out the cash value -LRB- less any surrender charges , outstanding loans , or interest , if applicable -RRB- . There is also the option to let it run out on it 's own . When you no longer contribute premiums to the policy , it will steadily use up the cash value in the policy to continue the coverage until there is nothing left , at which the point the policy would `` crash '' on it 's own and no longer provide coverage . The third option is to change the structure of the policy . You may have the option to reduce the face amount of the policy -LRB- the death benefit -RRB- or reduce the length of coverage to lower the premiums to make the policy more affordable if cost is a concern . I would suggest your mother contact the agent on the policy and ask them to run midstreams to find out what the current values are on the policy , how long the coverage will go for on the guaranteed side and current assumption side of the program and what changes would it make to the policy given the above options . This will provide a good indication as to what course of action would be most appropriate .

Current assumption side means how long will the coverage go for given today 's values . "}

And if you ca n't afford to keep all of that policy in-force , reducing coverage or selling part of the policy to an investor for cash -LRB- called `` life settlement '' -RRB- is also a viable option worth looking into .

{"input": "Why Does Life Insurance Have Cash Value? ", "output": "David has given you a fine explanation of the mechanics of cash accumulation inside life insurance . I will address an additional point . One big reason for why life insurance has cash value is because that cash makes more people want to buy the product . When you think about it , life insurance really is not for the insured - it is for the beneficiaries of the insured . These include their families , their businesses , and their favorite charities . For many people , it is considered a necessary evil . They certainly want to do right by all these folks they support , but really - who wants to buy something that pays off when you die ? I think that from a marketing point of view , cash value sweetens the pot . It makes the product much more appealing . Now people can have their cake and eat it too . They can purchase a policy with a survivor benefit for their heirs . That policy can also have a cash account that is available to them while they are alive . They can use the money to supplement retirement ; buy a house ; fund a business ; and for emergencies Not only that : the cash receives very favorable tax treatment . You might ask , why does the government give such favorable tax treatment to life insurance ? One big reason is that there is no way on earth that federal and state governments could take care of all the people that benefit from life insurance . It simply could not collect enough money to pay all the windows , widowers , children , businesses , and charities for whom people buy policies . It is entirely in the governments interest for people to buy tons and tons of life insurance . And over time , people have . The life insurance industry has poured trillions of dollars into the economy so that people can remain self-reliant - and off of government subsidies . The side benefit of a cash account helps make that happen . "}

It is a way of saying , I love you , and I take care of you now . Im going to make sure that an insurance company takes care of you later .

As there are approximately 10,000 people turning 65 everyday , most with little or no retirement plans other than social security -LRB- which puts them well below poverty level in most cases -RRB- and no provision for protection from the increasing costs of long term care , we would probably find that the mortality rate among the +65 set would dramatically rise , and life expectancy lower , as a result of them not being able to afford the medical services that would be otherwise available .

Your Part B coverage requires a premium -LRB- $ 104.90 per month in 2014 -RRB- and you would pay a premium for any supplemental coverage - supplement plans are provided by private insurance companies .

Another great perk of the ACA is the subsidies that many people qualify for . Good luck , and thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "What Is Variable Term Life Insurance? ", "output": "Variable term life insurance ? Never heard of that ! You may be thinking of a variable ` premium ' or `` flexible premium '' life insurance . . ? As Peggy mentioned above , variable products have cash value and term policies do not . The `` variable '' component in those products is the amount of interest earned , because they are tied to investments in the stock market . A flexible premium life insurance would be a Universal Life policy , which is actually similar to a term policy where the cost of insurance goes up and once that exceeds what is being paid in premiums the sach value is consumed until there is no more insurance . There is such a thing as `` indexed '' universal Life , which is tied to a stock index and therefore the interest paid into the cash value will vary depending on the performance of the index . "}

If you 're over 65 , you 're likely looking at Medicare coverage if you do n't qualify for any retiree programs from an employer . On Medicare , you 're looking at a couple of different options . If you want more comprehensive type coverage , you would want to buy a Medicare Supplement plan -LRB- also known as a Medigap plan -RRB- and pair it with a Part D prescription drug plan -LRB- if you want drug coverage -RRB- .

'' Who would you choose ? Benefits are a way for the employer to entice and retain employees . The other reason is that if you have insurance , you can afford to go to the doctor and be treated . without the coverage , you miss work , or are forced to quit , impacting the companies profits by increasing turnover , training costs , and lost productivity.The employer also pays a portion of what the total cost of the coverage would have been , if you 'd have had to pay for it yourself .

{"input": "How To Deal With Auto Insurance Claim Adjusters? ", "output": "Although more information is needed to adequately address this very general question , a few points can be made . I am going to make the assumption that you are talking about physical damage to your vehicle , with no injury . If you are asking about dealing with the person who will physically inspect your vehicle , they or someone on their behalf should first contact you , to set up an inspection at your convenience . This is really an ` appraiser ' of the damages although they may also possess claim settlement authority to settle your claim on-site , in certain non-injury situations . If you are talking about a typical inside claim adjuster , expect a call from them , asking you to provide the details of the accident . After assessing the facts , the adjuster 's job is to make you whole for your loss , depending upon the liability circumstances involved . In both instances , you should expect to be treated with respect whether you are the policyholder or the person whose vehicle was damaged by another party . If you are not pleased with the process , tell the appraiser or adjuster so and then ask to speak to their superior .

As an agent in Memphis , Tennessee I can assure you that there are lots of people in Arkansas and Mississippi who wish they could purchase individual health insurance in Tennessee . The cost differences -LRB- which always varied from state to state -RRB- are now substantially different and higher for the residents of Arkansas and Mississippi . That 's not to say health insurance costs are n't higher in Tennessee in 2014 but they did go up far less than in surrounding states . You may have been confused by some politicians talking about allowing the purchase of health insurance policies across state lines . However , this is not how the Affordable Care Act is currently structured . While this idea sounds great on the face of it , it is neither practical nor a real solution for the cost problems individuals and small businesses are being presented with . All health care is local and just as the cost of living and real estate prices are vastly different from New York City to Omaha , Nebraska , the same is true of health care and the health insurance plans tied to it in a given geographic area .

A combination of both may be right for you . It really depends upon your specifics . If you 'd like to discuss them , drop me an email , and I 'd happily give you some better information , okay ?

I like that I own the policy , I control the policy . I like that as an investment it is dull , boring and does it job of a reasonable return at a minimal risk situation . I like after all my health changes -LRB- type II , A Fib -RRB- that I do not have to seek out life insurance again because I have mine , locked in for my life . I like how in 2008 when I lost ten years of growth off my investments and my home value dipped too , that my life insurance kept cooking along as if nothing happened . I like that something I have ca n't go backwards . I figured out a long time ago , whole life insurance is the most risky thing an insurance company can sell for an insurance company , that is why it is priced the way it is . Think about this if you were an insurance company and price based on risk to the company , would the things that could really cost you , do you charge a little or a lot ?

In most states coverage for auto related claims will fall under your auto insurance . Having said that , some homeowners insurance policies provide coverage for theft away from premises . The more important question is , `` What is your homeowners insurance deductible ? '' If you have a $ 500 deductible and the key FOB is $ 500 , and it was covered , you would collect $ 0 because you have n't exceeded your deductible . Even if your policy did provide coverage , and you exceeded your deductible , I would n't recommend you file a claim . Homeowners insurance is best reserved for catastrophic losses like ; wind , fire , hail , lightning , hurricanes , water damage from a pipe burst , etc. . If you file a claim for your key FOB and next week have to file another claim because of something listed above , the insurance company will have grounds to non-renew or cancel your policy . Even if they did n't cancel your policy , you could see a rate increase because of the claim that was submitted for your key FOB . Over the next few years you would likely exceed the value of the key FOB with increased insurance premium cost . The thought process by the insurance companies is `` frequency leads to severity '' and insurance companies do not like severity . Hope this answer helps . "}

For instance , if you paid for the entire year and you cancel six months into the term , they 'll refund half the premium . Now some things to be aware of : Do n't cancel your current coverage until you have new coverage in place . If you have a mortgage , be sure to notify your mortgage company about the new coverage . They may send you a notice that they have no coverage and you need to address this or they will force coverage at an extremely high rate that only protects them , not you .

When it renews , they 've collected enough to pay the full year again , and the process continues that way . If you cancel during the year , the refund will come directly to you , not the mortgage company , and your escrow may be short .

First , take the advice of one of the richest men in the world , Warren Buffet . His advice Rule 1 `` do n't lose '' . Rule 2 `` refer to rule 1 '' . So cover your ass-etts first , buy yourself some decent insurance . if a calamity befalls you , you will not be financially out of the game . Somebody will suffer the calamity . It may be you . 1 . For free life insurance advice , go to www.lfehappens.org and figure out how much you need now . Then buy it . Today . You are not bulletproof . You likely have a friend your age that has died . No second chance . 2 . Car insurance . Since the average SUV you might hit costs lots more than the minimum coverages , do n't get minimum liability coverage . If you hit someone , and have less coverage than what you hit , you may end up paying for the rest of the SUV you hit out of pocket . While I am on it , buy a car you can afford to lose . Pay cash if you can . Cars are just the cost of getting to work . By paying cash , you can save 4,000 a year or more . A nice little pile . Remember : We fly around all day in 30 year old airliners . Airlines maintain their planes meticulously . Maintain your vehicle and it will last . Fall in love with your spouse and your children , not your car . 3 .

{"input": "What Are The Best Ways For Someone Under 30 To Start Planning For Retirement? ", "output": "The easiest answer is to `` do something '' . Save something . If your employer does n't provide a 401K match , open up a Roth IRA and make regular , periodic deposits to the account . An IRA or non-qualified annuity are fine too . If you are in business and have no employees , open up a SEP -LRB- simplified employer pension -RRB- . All of the latter have limits to the contributions and eligibility . You should consider setting aside your retirement contribution before you spend on anything else . I suggest saving 10-20 % , with half of these funds liquid in demand savings accounts but only to the point you have enough on hand to equal 6 months of your living expenses . Then move more of the money into a tax preferred account until you max out your contribution limits . You can use life insurance as an asset accumulation vehicle as well and as you age you may be able to violate the TAMRA and turn the policies into modified endowment contracts that can become cash cows you fatten up for the future . Do n't forget variable and fixed index accounts , and mutual funds and stock index accounts . This should give you enough food for research but I 'd start with safe accounts and build out with an eye on avoiding the ravages of taxation until the government says you have met the limits of the tax preferenced acounts . Good luck . Oh , by the way , the longer you wait to start the harder it will be to accomplish money enough for retirement . I can prove mathematically that someone who starts today and maximizes their contributions for ten years can not be eclipsed by someone waiting for ten years and starting the same process even if you quit and all other factors are equal . It 's true , so , get started and good luck . You may be relying upon yourself more in retirement than you know today . "}
{"input": "What Are The Best Ways For Someone Under 30 To Start Planning For Retirement? ", "output": "What are the best ways for someone under 30 to start planning for retirement ? Well first get out of the planning phase and start the doing phase . Getting the habit of saving going is the best thing you can do for yourself . Time is the most important and actually cheapest thing you can invest . People say they will start saving when they pay off debt , but most people will carry some sort of debt throughout their working lives and beyond . Save and pay down debt . Getting the habit early means actually using less money . The advantage of starting early is that you can do several things over time with different risk and reward profiles . You have time to pick and use safe , moderate and high risk investments because time works in your favor . Waiting until your older actually forces you into more risk situations as you try and make up for time by choosing higher risk investments because you need a high return . Getting started young , building your safety net allows you to take some risk because you have a fall back position , not a desperation position . "}

I 'm sure we 'd all agree that we expect all businesses to operate ethically , and with the best of intentions . So I guess your question comes down to one of two things - is life insurance a scam ?

It is a certainty that you will die . Tough , but true . If your employer provides life insurance for you , and you 've opted to take it and die while employed , that benefit can be a big help in paying for your funeral and providing for those you 've left behind .

{"input": "Is Corporate Owned Life Insurance Ethical? ", "output": "The simple answer is `` Yes ! '' Corporate Owned Life Insurance -LRB- COLI -RRB- is ethical . However , in recent years , because of some of the abuses , it has become more scrutinized in its uses . There are many valid reasons for using COLI . It could be very important to a company if a key person in their company died . In some cases , it would take months or years to replace that person with a specific skill set ; so COLI maybe purchased to offset the loss . It may also be used as `` golden handcuffs '' , where the life insurance builds cash value for a future date to pay executive retirement beyond a 401k . This can be done formally , through legal documents -LRB- the IRS even identifies it by code number much like `` 401k '' -RRB- . The unethical part came into play when companies purchased life insurance of people where they had no insurable interest -LRB- in other words would not be at risk of significant loss by the death of the person insured under the policy -RRB- . For example , CompanyZ purchased COLI on all of its 22,000 employees - from executives done to the maintenance.When a rank-in-file employee died , Company Z kept the death benefit , giving them a tax free benefit . The courts decided that Company Z did not have an insurable interest and required them to pay the family the death benefit . The policy was clearly determined not to be COLI but to be STOLI -LRB- Stranger Owned Life Insurance -RRB- . "}

{"input": "Is Health Insurance Included In W2 Wages? ", "output": "Many employees have been surprised and concerned to see the value of their employer provided health insurance being reported on their W2 's . This is a requirement of the Affordable Care Act . Under transitional relief guidelines issued , so far only employers who issue 250 or more W2 forms in a calendar year are required to report this information . Eventually all employers who provide health insurance to their employees will be required to report this information on the employee 's W2 . This reporting of the employer paid amount for health insurance is for `` informational '' purposes only and is not being added to the employee 's gross income for income tax purposes . There are some skeptics who see this as a precursor to the eventual tax treatment of employer paid health insurance as employee income at some future date but at this time there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act or any pending legislation that would do this . Where this reporting of employer paid health insurance will become a tax issue will be in 2018 when the `` Cadillac Tax '' portion of the health care law goes into effect . The Cadillac Tax will be a 40 % excise tax imposed on health insurance plans whose annual premium costs exceed $ 10,200 for an individual or $ 27,500 for family coverage -LRB- these amounts will be indexed for inflation -RRB- . So , an employer in 2018 who finds themselves with health plan premium levels exceeding these amounts will be assessed a 40 % tax penalty . While such annual premium amounts may seem unreachable by many persons in 2014 . In some areas of the country , and especially with some very rich collectively bargained plans , total costs are already coming close to these trigger points . When one observes the increases in group health insurance plan costs already triggered by the requirements of the Affordable Care Act in 2014 and applies projected inflationary trend increases over the next few years it becomes much easier to estimate that a larger portion of employer based plans could find themselves subject to this tax penalty . This is one of the underlying motivations for more employers to move to high deductible health insurance plans in order to reduce their premium costs . "}

{"input": "How To Compare Home Insurance Rates? ", "output": "This topic must be approached with great caution !!! Those shopping for home insurance most usually get involved in a self inflicted scam of shopping unlike products and end up making a final decision on something other than their goal ! It is very difficult to compare like coverage between insurance carriers ; thus allowing a true similar comparison . Carriers sometimes offer different deductibles , different coverage limits and different endorsement options . Depending on the customer 's needs , it is often that an important item goes unchecked in haste to complete the transaction . We recommend shopping for insurance not more frequently than once every three years and taking at least an hour to go over the coverage in detail before making a change of carrier.In today 's economy , there are clients that spend 10 - 15 minutes each and every year and simply contact someone after receiving an advertisement of a lower rate ; the topic of coverage goes untouched and the client saves $ 20 over the prior carrier 's premium . The truth will come out when there is a claim and the client questions why he/she did n't have the necessary coverage ; please do not fall into this trap - it defies the purpose of purchasing the insurance coverage in the first place . In some of these ` rush ' cases , it is also possible that following an inspection of the property , the carrier legally makes necessary changes and the client ends up with a higher premium than what they originally had with the prior carrier . It is prudent to purchase insurance at least one month ahead of the desired effective date to give the new carrier time to order an inspection and send notice of any changes which the homeowner may decide against . This would also allow you time to pay your renewal and continue with the prior carrier . The best recommendation in most parts of the United States is to try and find an insurance brokerage that represents a number of carriers ; you should call and speak to a broker explaining exactly what you 're looking for and supply a copy of your current policy for the broker to properly compare the coverage and endorsements and ask the broker to contact you if they can come up with a better offer without discounting any coverage . In addition , you may wish to contact a couple of the National Captive carriers such as Allstate and State Farm and obtaining a comparison quote . This way , you can compare the work of a broker against the Captive agents of Allstate or State Farm making sure you have completed a concise and informed cycle of review .

Let 's tackle the first issue and that is of the professional or product liability . A homeowner policy will not extend itself to cover the liability that arises our of the professional services to write software or machine code that is either given away or incorporated into a commercial product offered to others . In the event of a loss of lawsuit I do n't think you will find coverage and I think if a claim were to be presented a `` reservation of rights '' letter will be issued upon notification of a claim so the carrier can explore the issue prior to rejecting the loss as `` professional liability '' that is not covered in a liability section of a home insurance policy . On the other hand , many companies permit the use of the home for office related tasks and the liability exposure for pedestrian traffic onto the property and/or into the house will probably be covered when the avocation is merely a hobby . Usually the presence of this additional exposures are required to be admitted to the carrier . That said , all claims issues are ultimately compared against coverage terms and language and no one should rely on this general advice as anything other than a reminder to consult with your insurance agent for the best answer . And finally , I am aware of no coverage that is available for the hobby coder to add to a home insurance policy .

For example , it is likely that your policy has an `` inflation guard '' provision that increases the dwelling amount provided each year . If the dwelling amount on your home increased over last year , that would certainly account for a premium increase . If you suffered a covered loss and had to file a claim , that might affect your renewal premium . If your area was hit with heavy weather related losses , like the ice daming that the North East and specificlally CT was plagued by , even if yo were not affected , your company might have had to take a rate adjustment as a result of the losses .

Universal Life is most often referred to as Permanent insurance , but it 's really a hybrid of Term and Whole Life ... and it will expire and be void of cash value and any benefits at some point unless you ` over fund ' it . Unfortunately that part is rarely explained to people when buying insurance . The main kinds of Term Insurance are Mortgage , Credit and Life . They 're all basically the same in that they are in force for a limited period of time and pay the benefit amount to the named beneficiary upon the death of the insured . In the case of mortgage and credit policies the beneficiary is the mortgage or credit provider . In the case of Term Life usually the beneficiary is the spouse , children or other relative of the insured . Also with Term Life there may be an accelerated benefit rider that pays a percentage of the death benefit to the insured in the case of critical or chronic illness or injury . There are a large variety of Permanent Life policies available . Whole Life Paid Up at a predetermined age , -LRB- such as 65 , 95 , 121 , etc -RRB- , is the kind that never ` expires ' and continues to grow cash value until the benefit is paid . As mentioned above there are `` Universal Life '' policies , which can be ` fixed ' , ` indexed ' or ` variable ' .

In other words you the insured are self insuring part of the loss which is the deductible amount you have chosen . For example if you have a $ 2,500 deductible on your homeowners insurance and your house is damage by fire -LRB- which is a covered loss -RRB- , then you the insured would be responsible for the first $ 2,500 in damages and the insurance company would pay the rest of the damage up to the policy limit .

{"input": "Can A Landlord Force You To Buy Renters Insurance? ", "output": "If your lease agreement has a clause requiring Renters Insurance , yes , the Landlord may enforce the clause thereby forcing you to buy Renters Insurance or being in breach of the contract . Renters Insurance is a valuable coverage ; many renters simply deny the issue due to the small cost of coverage . In our many years in business , we have seen a variety of claims ; the following is just a short synopsis of the necessary protection . Renters Insurance includes Personal Property Coverage and Personal Liability Insurance . Liability Insurance being the more important coverage as this is where a legal action against the renter could cause undue hardship . If a fire or water damage claim is caused by the renter , the renter would be negligent and therefore liable for the damage caused . Although the property may be insured , the insurance carrier of the Landlord would subrogate and may bring legal action against the tenant . Personal Property coverage would provide protection against theft , fire and water damage to the contents of the renter . The Landlord 's insurance does not cover the tenant 's property in any way ; neither does it allow for legal protection of the tenant . Should a tenant not be interested in this valuable protection , we recommend purchasing the minimum available personal property coverage with the minimum liability protection of $ 100,000 . This coverage would cost in the range of $ 100 - $ 300 per year depending on the region of the country and the specific insurance carrier underwriting the risk .

{"input": "Is Homeowners Insurance Mandatory? ", "output": "Check with your attorney but I doubt that your state requires homeowners insurance .

{"input": "What Does Face Amount Mean In Life Insurance? ", "output": "The face amount of the policy represents the face amount the policy is scheduled to pay out . In the case of a graded death benefit the policy will pay a reduced amount for the first 2 or three policy years before going to the actual face amount . Some companies pay dividends . These dividends can be used to buy additional insurance thus increasing the death benefit . But dividends are not guaranteed Should you die the beneficiary would receive the Face amount of the policy plus any paid up insurance accumulated by the dividends . In the case of a Universal Life policy , the policy would pay the face amount plus if you choose you can have the death benefit increased by any cash value accumulated in the policy . Because of the nature of Universal Life you need to make sure you are paying sufficient premium to keep the policy in force , otherwise the policy would lose the death benefit entirely . Always read your annual statement if you have a Universal Life policy . "}
{"input": "What Does Face Amount Mean In Life Insurance? ", "output": "The face amount means the amount the policy isinitially based on . It does n't always equal the death benefit because during the first two or three policy years , some policies will only pay a % of the face amount . Other policies will grow and pay higher amounts as the policy grows . "}
{"input": "What Does Face Amount Mean In Life Insurance? ", "output": "Two great responses so far ! The other angle I would put on the question is that the `` Face Amount '' is the amount the insurance company promises to pay based on the contract that the insured or owner of the policy agreed to or entered into with the insurance company . For example , based on a term policy contract , if the insurance company promises to pay $ 250,000 of death benefit if the insured dies while still covered by the insurance , the beneficiary will receive $ 250,000 when the claim is paid . The `` Face Amount '' is $ 250,000 . Based on a permanent policy -LRB- for example -RRB- , the the insurance company promises to pay $ 250,000 of death benefit minus any outstanding loans against the policy . If the insured dies while still covered by the insurance , but had utilized -LRB- borrowed -RRB- $ 25,000 from the policy , the beneficiary will receive $ 225,000 when the claim is paid . The `` Face Amount '' is still $ 250,000 , but the contract has wording that describes how much the beneficiaries are paid . -LRB- In some cases it can be `` more '' than the `` Face Amount '' based on gains in the contract and/or dividends . -RRB- There are numerous examples that could be listed , but between all of our answers , I sure do hope that helps you understand a bit more , and highlights the assistance that a qualified licensed insurance professional can offer you !

{"input": "What Does Face Amount Mean In Life Insurance? ", "output": "The face amount in life insurance means the amount of insurance you buy . The death benefit is the amount that is actually paid to the beneficiary when death occurs . The face amount almost always equals the death benefit in term insurance .

It will also prevent creditors from having access to your life insurance benefit . "}
{"input": "Do Life Insurance Proceeds Go Into Estate? ", "output": "Life insurance proceeds can go the estate of the insured on purpose or by accident but there is no reason they should . Naming a beneficiary and reviewing periodically is usually the right thing to do . If the estate is the beneficiary , the access of the heirs to any money associated with the life insurance policy is delayed because the money must go through probate . Probate may , in some cases , cause a delay of a year or more . Life insurance proceeds left to the estate , like any asset left to the estate , are forced through the probate process and therefore become part of the public record , so privacy is lost . Perhaps most importantly , in most states , the money paid into probate becomes subject to the claims of creditors of the estate . "}

{"input": "Can Life Insurance Have More Than One Beneficiary? ", "output": "This is a very interesting question because life insurance carriers allow for a lot of flexibility in beneficiary designations . For example , you have the primary beneficiary . This person -LRB- or entity , such as a corporation or trust -RRB- will get the money when the insured dies . What if I unfortunately the primary beneficiary is not alive -LRB- or in business -RRB- when the insured dies ? That is why you can designate a contingent beneficiary . This beneficiary will get the money in those exact circumstances - when the primary beneficiary is not available . What if you wanted to name multiple primary or contingent beneficiaries ? That can be done . Do they have to get equal shares ? No . As a matter of fact , especially when the contingent beneficiary is children , parents often do not apportion the benefit equally . What if you want to set up successor beneficiaries along bloodlines ? Such as your child , but if your child is not available , then your childs child ? This can also be done . Make sure you discuss this with your estate planning attorney . What if you want to make the beneficiaries minors ? Not a good idea . An insurance company will not release money to a minor . You will need to do some estate planning to secure that money . "}
{"input": "Can Life Insurance Have More Than One Beneficiary? ", "output": "Certainly life insurance policies allow for more than one beneficiary . Here is the thing to keep in mind , almost all life insurance companies deal in percentages versus amounts . For example if you have three beneficiaries you can not leave equal amounts .

You have the option to put on primary beneficiaries , contingent beneficiaries -LRB- in case the primary predeceases the insured -RRB- , and even tertiary beneficiaries if you 'd like -LRB- in case the primary and contingent beneficiaries predecease the insured -RRB- . Each level -LRB- primary , contingent , and tertiary -RRB- can have more than one beneficiary . You also want to make sure to designate what happens to a beneficiary 's share if he/she predeceases the insured -LRB- especially if there is more than 1 beneficiary - e.g. does it go to the other beneficiary ? to the estate ? to someone else ? etc. -RRB- The other thing you want to make sure of is that the policy structure does not violate the `` Goodman Triangle '' -LRB- named after a court case -RRB- . The Goodman Triangle , in short , states that 2 of the 3 parties of a life insurance contract must be the same to avoid certain tax consequences -LRB- same owner and beneficiary with a different insured or same owner and insured with a different beneficiary -RRB- . If you want to place more than one beneficiary on the policy , the owner and insured would have to be the same person to not violate the Goodman Triangle . When the Goodman Triangle is violated , the situation can result in the monies being subject to estate taxes or gift tax consequences . If a policy is owned by a trust such as an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust -LRB- ILIT -RRB- , the insured and beneficiary will be the trust and the insured will be the person who 's life the trust was created for . The trust would illustrate all of the payout structure scenarios when the insured dies and a claim is made on the policy .

This is to address the possible situation where the primarybeneficiary named at the time the policy is issued passes away before or at the same time as the policy holder -LRB- think of a husband and wife being killed at the same time in a car accident for instance -RRB- .

{"input": "Why Are Insurance Companies Able To Discriminate? ", "output": "I think Discriminate depends on how you mean it . In cases of offering a product , a carrier can not discriminate by race . A carrier can not discriminate beyond what the state they are doing business in allows . In some states this may mean unisex pricing or outlawing `` red lining '' in others . Any insurance plan MUST be approved by each state 's department of insurance and subject to a review prior to allowing the product to be sold . An insurance carrier may be able to create separate classes within a type of policy by showing the statistical probabilities behind doing so . Women tend to live longer than men , This can be shown statistically so separate pricing can discriminate between the two sexes . This could be applied to smoking , weight , year of birth , health conditions and so on . . So if an insurance company can show a statistical difference based on gathered information , they can `` discriminate '' that way `` if '' the state allows it . What they ca n't do is take two people who are the same in every way and deny coverage for A while taking B into the plan . "}
{"input": "Why Are Insurance Companies Able To Discriminate? ", "output": "They price their products based on risk . That 's what insurance is .

If you have bad health , you have to pay more for health insurance and life insurance . You are more likely to be making claims on the insurance sooner . To not charge you more would require charging more to healthy people . Health insurance is changing from true insurance to an entitlement program . This will make it less costly than it is now for unhealthy people but it will raise rates for all the healthier and younger ones . It should be a good change but time will tell . But to answer your question ... would YOU want to be the insurance company and charge a 16-year old male driver with three tickets the same rate as the 45-year old woman with no tickets .

Term life insurance will be the least expensive and as it 's name implies it covers you for a fixed term or period of time -LRB- usually 10 , 20 or 30 years -RRB- . Whole life insurance policies are generally designed to cover you throughout life and until death . Whole life insurance policies are more expensive but they often offer features such a cash build up , the ability to be paid up in full over a certain period of time but continue in force until the policy holder 's death . Most people purchase a mix of these two types of policies to cover their differing needs throughout different stages of their lives . For example , you will probably have a need for more life insurance during your working years when you are getting married , having children , have a mortgage and other financial obligations that you want to protect your survivor 's from if you were to pass away during that stage of life . Having a large amount of financial protection with lower cost term insurance for these years is an approach used by many people . They then often compliment the term policy with a lesser amount of permanent life insurance to make sure that if the pass away in old age that their funeral expenses and any outstanding debts are taken care of and that they perhaps leave an inheiritance to their spouse , children and/or grandchildren .

The design is simple : a fixed pool of money with as much access to it -LRB- maximum daily or monthly benefit -RRB- that one can afford . There is no accommodation for inflation and no riders , except perhaps the `` monthly home care '' rider which if not part of the contract should be added . It does n't cost much as a rider .

The design includes the lowest cost inflation rider , monthly home care rider -LRB- if not included in the base plan -RRB- and maybe survivor waiver of premium . The pool of money to pay care costs and daily/monthly access to it should be as much as can reasonably afforded.A premium plan -LRB- which we used to illustrate routinely five years ago -RRB- for a couple can run from $ 9,000 - $ 14,000 / yr . depending on which combination of bells and whistles you want and can afford .
