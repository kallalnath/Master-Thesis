{"input": "Can My Car Insurance Drop Me? ", "output": "Yes , they can , in certain situations . I 'll say first that I can only answer for Michigan but most states do behave similarly . Your eligibility for auto insurance with a standard carrier is measured on a point system . To be eligible for a standard carrier in Michigan , you can not have more than 6 eligibility points . The point system is pretty simple , with more points for more serious infractions . For instance , a speeding ticket for 5mph over the speed limit , and other similar violations are worth two points while an at fault accident is worth three . These points do have an expiration , normally two to three years for accidents and minor violations . Major violations such as a DUI or wreckless driving expire in five years and one of these deems you ineligible . Your insurance company can cancel your policy if you reach 7 points or more that have n't expired . Two at fault accidents in the last three years will also get you here as your second at fault is charged four eligibility points . Two things to consider : First , you can still get insurance if you have been cancelled but it 'll cost you a lot more . Second , do n't think that , just because the judge said he 'd waive the points from a ticket , these wo n't count for insurance purposes because they will . If it shows up on a driving record or a claims record , the companies have no choice but to apply them .

If too much premium is paid into the policy in violation of Section 7702 of the IRC , the policy is no longer considered life insurance , and the death benefit is income taxable . Insurance companies monitor this and usually take action to prevent such violations . Insurance professionals worry more about the following more common situations where the death benefit can be taxable since the burden is on the policy owner to monitor and violations are usually not caught before it is too late . 1 . Since 2006 , new rules apply to life insurance in a business context which subjects the life insurance death benefit to income tax . If the policy does not meet the special requirements of Section 101 -LRB- j -RRB- such as the notice and consent or protected class requirementsthe death benefit may be income taxable . There is also an annual IRS reporting requirement -LRB- Form 8925 -RRB- . We find most small business owners are not aware , especially of the latter requirement . Most tax professionals are usually not aware either . This is a common and growing problem which generally can not be corrected -LRB- except to cancel policies and start over -RRB- . 2 .

While as a general rule life insurance death benefits are not taxable , there are a few more cases that can be taxable .

Many states have limits lower than federal limits and may become subject to state taxation should the entire value of the estate exceed the state exemption . Also , it is important to avoid the Goodman Triangle . There are three parties involved in a life insurance contract , besides the insurance company . There is the insured , the person being covered , the owner , the person who controls the policy and typically pays the premium , and the beneficiary , the person named to receive the death benefit . It is important that at least two of these be in common to avoid Federal Income Tax . That means the owner should be either the insured or the beneficiary . To be safe , work with an insurance professional who is familiar with these rules to help you avoid problems .

{"input": "When Should I Buy Rental Car Insurance?

Most auto insurance companies will extend the liability and physical damage coverage to a car you rent . However , they usually will not cover `` loss of use '' . Even though your insurance will normally fix the car , the rental company will bill you for the daily rental of that car until it 's repaired and put back into service . Your auto insurance wo n't usually cover this cost . Think about it this way : if the car costs $ 30/day to rent and it takes 2 weeks to fix it and put it back in service , the rental car company will expect you to pay that $ 420 that it could have gotten if they had the car to rent . Their coverage will normally waive these costs . If you do n't carry physical damage on your own car , then you also have no physical damage coverage on a rental car . So , if you do n't have your own auto policy , or you do n't have physical damage coverage on your policy , I would recommend taking the rental company 's coverage .

No exams , limited health questions , and it can be issued in just a few days . It sounds like a great deal , right ? The important thing to look at when buying any coverage is the structure of the policy and the premiums that you 're paying throughout it 's life rather than just what you 're paying for the first month because chances are ... you 're going to live longer than 1 month into the policy . Some policies offer level premium guarantee periods -LRB- e.g. you 're paying the same premium for 10 years , 15 years , 20 years , or 30 years before the premium can go up , or you 're locking it in for life with a GUL or WL policy -RRB- . Other policies feature banded coverage meaning the premium may be cheaper up front than level premium policies , but they go up when you hit the next age bracket in it 's structure -LRB- typically every 5 years -RRB- . A banded policy can sound like a great thing for the first few years , but if you keep it for a long time it will likely become much more expensive and the cumulative premium that you 've paid can/will be a lot higher than what you would have paid under a level premium policy .

In the group policy setting when employees are paying their premiums on a pre-tax basis then changes to coverage are limited to the annual open enrollment period or change of life status events -LRB- e.g. - marriage , divorce , child birth/adoption , loss of other coverage -RRB- . So , you and your spouse ca n't have a fight over the weekend and the your spouse walks into work on Monday and drops you from their group health insurance just out of spite . With individual health policies it is easier to change the coverage level at any month of the policy period . Now , thanks to ObamaCare , which somehow managed to not define a spouse as a dependent for health insurance purposes -LRB- remember `` We 've got to pass the law to find out what 's in it '' from Nancy Pelosi ? -RRB- . This has changed the potential status of spouses being defined as eligible dependents under the personnel policies of some employer 's group health plans . While relatively few employers have dropped coverage for spouses entirely , many employers are beginning to adopt personnel policies that require that employee 's spouses who are employed and have health insurance coverage available through their employer to enroll in their employer 's health plan or some are assessing a penalty or extra charge to spouses who do n't enroll in outside coverage through their employer 's plans .

{"input": "What Is Joint Life Insurance Policy? ", "output": "A joint survivorship life insurance policy is a pretty ingenious creation . The idea is to have two insureds on one policy . Whats so good about that ? From an insurance companys point of view , they dont have to pay the benefit until the second insured dies . This can give them more years to collect and invest premium , than they would have with only one insured . Can you imagine if one of the insureds was much younger than the other say with an older gentleman and his younger new bride ? Decades could pass before a claim will be made . From the insureds point of view , blended underwriting can work very much to their joint advantage . Take the example above . The husband may unfortunately be older , and in ill health . He may be uninsurable , or eligible at a very high rate . However , his younger wife may qualify for the lowest rates available . The premium they would have to pay jointly could be very reasonable . Not only that : the husband may get coverage whereas on his own , that would be impossible . You can see that joint survivorship life insurance can be a very affordable way to cover needs such as estate preservation , and making charitable bequests . "}

{"input": "What Does Group Life Insurance Mean? ", "output": "Group life insurance is life insurance coverage for an employee that is paid for by their employer - the amount is generally for coverage up to the employees salary , or a multiple of their salary -LRB- e.g. 1.5 x or 2x salary -RRB- . Additional coverage is sometimes offered for an additional cost to be paid by the employee . The cost for additional coverage may be lower for a younger person -LRB- in their 20s , 30s , or 40s -RRB- , but group coverage most often has premiums banded in 5 year intervals . For example , a given rate is charged for someone between ages 35-39 , a higher rate for 40-44 , and so on . Please note , while there 's many great aspects to group coverage , there 's also big limitations to it as well : 1 -RRB- You do n't own the coverage 2 -RRB- Coverage is limited . If you want a larger amount of coverage , you will need to purchase an individual policy to provide the supplementing amount . 3 -RRB- If you leave the company , you lose your coverage - this is a HUGE item to keep in mind and a tremendous reason to buy an individual policy . You may have slightly higher premiums with an individual policy , but the pros are substantial - e.g. even if you quit or are fired from the company , you can keep coverage going . 4 -RRB- If you leave your company , some group coverage may allow you to convert your policy to a permanent program to keep it going . However , it is generally extremely expensive to do so and the premiums can be much higher than securing an individual policy . 5 -RRB- The cost of insurance as you get older on a group policy -LRB- e.g. age 55 , 60 , 65 , etc. -RRB- becomes very expensive compared to the cost of buying an individual one . You may want to ask for a list of rates for current employees at those ages as well as retired employees that keep their coverage . "}

My feeling is that it should be treated as icing on the cake , meaning that it can not be considered the main source of security for your family .

{"input": "When is a Life Insurance Policy regarded as \"in force\"? ", "output": "This is probably a situation where you will want to get some legal advice . I have seen cases explained where it went both ways . The answer to your general question , however , is that the policy does not actually go into effect until the first payment is made and required delivery paperwork is received . What happens so often during life insurance underwriting is that you are not speaking with the person who makes the ultimate decisions . The fact that they told you to send in the first payment sounds like a good move on their part , so that base would at least be covered . But the legalities have to then go by their teams who make those complicated decisions . And far too often , auto generated memos go out without taking into account the whole situation . I say this not as an excuse for insurance companies , but just because we run into this a lot , where their letters have not caught up with current reality .

{"input": "When is a Life Insurance Policy regarded as \"in force\"? ", "output": "As tragic as the circumstances , I suspect that the answer that will be sustained will be the one that declares the policy was actually in force at the actual time the premium was received . Most policies contain language that says something similar to : `` in consideration of the premiums paid ... '' . Premium is the inducement for the carrier to provide the protection and enter into the contractual agreement to provide coverage . We almost always encourage our life insurance applicants to send premium with an application to invoke any temporary insurance agreements -LRB- provisions for obtaining coverage while the application is considered for issuance -RRB- . When the carrier accepts the application , and there are no counter offers or amendments , the premium payment causes coverage to become effective in most instances . I explain to my customers it is better to be insured while deciding than to take a chance , however small , that conditions will change during the underwriting process or that they may pass unexpectedly while waiting . Nevertheless , you may indeed find legal advice helpful and I am certainly not giving legal advice . Insurance companies are very careful and they act and behave in certain ways because of the experience they have had defending their written contracts . Insurance laws are also under constant review in courts so I suspect you might find legal advice useful .

I 'm sure everyone sympathizes with you as I do , however there are rules that govern pretty much everything as you indicated that you are aware . So the answer to your question : When is a life insurance policy considered `` In Force '' ? is that the policy is in force when all the delivery requirements are met and the first premium is paid . In this case the policy was in force , but then lapsed thus it was no longer in force . Your husband applied for reinstatement , which reinstatement was approved according to your account , however the premium had not yet been paid , nor the approval been given by the insurer when your husband died . Therefore the policy was not in force on your husband 's death and the insurer is not obligated to pay the benefit . Even if your husband had submitted the reinstatement premium with his application for reinstatement , since the company had not approved or accepted the reinstatement before your husband died the policy did not meet the requirements for inforceability . Had he submitted the premium and the company accepted and approved the reinstatement before he died then the policy would have been in force and the company would be obligated to pay the benefit . "}

On the high risk end of the spectrum are the adjustable , variable , or universal policies.Though they may carry any of these terms in the name , the basic working chassis is the same . With these policies your risk to gain or lose is not guaranteed . You basically play the market within your policy with the funds that are in it . If your investments do well , then your policy may make money , remain solvent , and have steady premium payments for you . If the market is n't doing so hot , like lately , or your investment choices were n't the best , your policy may go belly up , or require higher premium payments from you to keep it solvent .

In some cases , a mix of both might be the right answer for you . If you 'd like to discuss your specific need , contact me , and I 'll clear some time on my schedule for you . Thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "Which Life Insurance Is Best Whole Or Term? ", "output": "It depends on the need . Term insurance is ideal for short term protection -LRB- e.g. paying off a mortgage or providing income in the event of an early or unexpected death -RRB- . Permanent insurance is ideal for long-term safety net protection , estate planning , retirement planning . Many people buy both types of coverage - some permanent to protect against the future after other debts are paid off and some term to cover time-limited debts -LRB- such as a mortgage , car , etc. -RRB- . Term insurance provides more bang-for-your-buck up front , but it 's only for a short period . Permanent insurance allows you to pay the same premium for the rest of your life without having to worry about it going up in the future . A brief description of the two types of coverage are as follows : Term life insurance guarantees the premiums will remain fixed for a specific number of years -LRB- 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , or 30 years -RRB- . Once the initial period of premium guarantee expires , the program changes to either annual renewable term insurance with premiums increasing each year -LRB- based on age -RRB- or the premiums remain the same and the death benefit decreases each year -LRB- this structure can be seen on term insurance that is featured on a universal life chassis . There is no cash value build-up in term insurance . Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for the rest of the insured 's life and build cash value . Under a guaranteed universal life -LRB- GUL -RRB- program , the policy can be structured to keep premiums level and provide coverage up to a specified age -LRB- e.g. to age 90 , to age 100 , or even up to age 121 -RRB- under the `` dial down '' process . Whole life features level premiums and death benefits and builds cash value at a faster rate -LRB- participating WL policies may pay dividends that can be used to increase the death benefit or decrease the premiums over time - non-participating WL policies do not feature this ability -RRB- - the trade off between this and guaranteed universal life is that to increase the cash value faster , the premiums will generally be substantially higher . For both GUL and WL , the carrier takes back the cash value upon the death of the insured , and pays out the death benefit proceeds . Therefore , GUL policies allow you to maximize your death benefit and minimize your premium dollars that you pay for the coverage . I highly recommend consulting with an independent insurance agent/broker to determine what policy benefit structure will best serve your needs , review quotes , and help you through the application and underwriting processes .

Not everyone can afford all the life insurance they need in permanent coverage . Yet buying only term presents the risk of being unable to qualify for a new policy when the current one expires . Putting money in the stock market and savings plans should cover final expense needs , eliminating the need for permanent life insurance . But will those investments and savings be there when you die ? My recommendations are to buy Term insurance for temporary needs , and Permanent insurance for lifelong needs . Specifically , permanent insurance is best for final expense needs such as funeral , burial , paying off credit cards , and other costs associated with putting the deceased to rest . Permanent insurance is recommended if you want to use the policy proceeds to pay estate taxes , pass money to heirs , or bequeath money to a charity . If you use term insurance for any purpose that may find you `` outliving the term '' , you may find that you no longer qualify for a new policy , and that all your plans for your life insurance are moot .

Most of my Georgia Medicare supplement clients purchase plan G and enjoy saving $ 300 or more each year vs. what they were paying for plan F with another carrier . "}

{"input": "What Are Disability Insurance Coverage Characteristics? ", "output": "The important factors that will play a large role in both the cost of a DI policy and how meaningful the benefit will be to a individual are ; The benefit amount , the elimination period , the duration of the benefit period , and the way in which the policy defines a disability . The benefit amount , the recurring monthly income your disability policy pays you while you are injured , represents the most important aspect of the coverage . Laws in most states limit disability insurance benefits to two-thirds of your current gross income . While most people select the maximum available benefit , you can choose lower amounts if your personal cash reserves are sufficient to supplement disability income payments . After you meet the criteria and are eligible to begin receiving income from your disability insurance policy , the length of time you must wait before payments begin is called the elimination period . Most major insurance carriers offer the same standard elimination periods ranging from one month to one year . Longer periods result in lower policy premiums . Once you begin receiving payments from your disability policy , they will continue until you are no longer disabled or your benefits have been exhausted . Disability insurance policies with maximum benefit periods of two years or less are classified as short-term disability products . If you own a short-term policy , payments will continue every month but will cease after two consecutive years . Policies with maximum benefit periods beyond two years are classified as long-term disability products . The most common benefit period choices for long-term policies are three years , five years , ten years or until age 65 . Every insurance company has its own formal definition of a disability , and benefit payments will not start unless your status falls within these guidelines . Some companies define disability as an inability to perform any gainful income-producing work at all . Collecting benefits under policies purchased from these carriers often presents a significant challenge . Thankfully , a large percentage of carriers consider you disabled if you are unable to perform the substantial duties of your own current employment position , a policy feature commonly referred to as `` own occupation . '' If your injury prevents you from adequately fulfilling the requirements of your current job , you are eligible to begin collecting benefits after the expiry of the elimination period . "}
{"input": "What Are Disability Insurance Coverage Characteristics? ", "output": "Some Disability Insurance coverage characteristics are elimination period -LRB- how long you must be disabled before the policy will pay a benefit -RRB- , length of coverage -LRB- how many years it will pay out -RRB- , percent of income replacement -LRB- dollar value of the policy payments -RRB- , and features that determine benefit triggers , amount , and duration . E.g. . An important policy consideration is whether to pay for the `` own occupation '' feature , which will allow you to collect at least a partial benefit if you are unable to perform your OWN job , as opposed to being able to work at ANY job .

{"input": "How Can I Sell My Life Insurance Policy? ", "output": "Video Transcript : Today 's question is , Can I sell my life insurance policy ? Well , number one , a life insurance policy is personal property . Could you sell it ? I think you can , usually through the life settlement market . But keep in mind that the original reason that you sold the life insurance was not to sell it for that specific purpose and most carriers and life insurance companies are going to take a dim view on you trying to buy insurance for just the purpose of selling it . But if the reason you bought life insurance does n't exist any longer , you could go ahead and sell it on the secondary market of life insurance settlement , and you can sell it for cash . Generally , a cash value contract is going to get a little bit more than what you have in your policy ; sometimes a lot more , depending upon the death benefit and your timeline . Can you sell it ? You could sell it and again , I recommend make sure that you 're doing this for the right reasons . And make sure that your coverage is no longer necessary . "}
{"input": "How Can I Sell My Life Insurance Policy? ", "output": "Viaticals , or life settlements , are the vehicles by which persons can sell their life insurance policies . However , the type of life insurance policy that can be sold is extremely limited . The policy nearly always has to have cash value , and the health of the insured person must be poor enough that those purchasing the policy , expect them to die within a short period of time , so that they can cash in on it . If you are in poor health and have a life insurance policy that you can no longer afford to pay for , you might ask your children if they would pitch in to pay the premiums . Then make them at least partial beneficiaries . If you need cash , you might be able to borrow from the cash value . Some policies even have `` living benefits '' where you can take part of the insurance proceeds in cash if you become critically , chronically , or terminally ill . Selling your life insurance policy should be a last resort . But if you do , be sure to deal with a reputable life settlement company . "}
{"input": "Does Renters Insurance Cover Food From Power Outage? ", "output": "-- > Normal 0 In the spirit of every reasonable insurance question is deserving of an answer , I submit . Tenant Homeowner or Renters policies cover damage to your personal property and food certainly would be considered Personal Property . As long as the power outage was caused by one of the named perils in your policy -LRB- fire , lightning , wind , vehicle damage , etc. -RRB- and it occurred on your premises , you may have a valid claim for food spoiled as a result of a power outage . But if the power outage was caused by something that occurred away from your residence , most Renters policies specifically exclude that type of loss unless the power outage then causes covered damage to your residence . Remember however , most Renters policies have a deductible of $ 250 or more so make sure you take that into consideration . Add to that the effect submitting a small claim , one less than $ 1000 , could have on your future premium or the willingness of your insurance company to renew your coverage . It may be a good idea to pass on submitting this type of claim even though you may have some coverage . In addition , most policies require you to take reasonable steps to preserve your property following a loss . Make sure you have done what you can to prevent your food from spoiling following a power outage . Some policies include a number of additional coverages , often an effort to make one companys policy appear more attractive than another . These additional coverages provide nominal amounts of insurance covering specific loss situations such as key replacement or food spoilage . Here again , you may be tempted to submit a claim because you have coverage but consider the impact a claim might have on future premiums and renewal terms . You may be better served to simply replace the food . When an event like this occurs , try to recall why you purchased insurance in the first place . More than likely , it wasnt to reimburse you if the food in your refrigerator went bad . "}

However , there are still employer groups whose policy is to terminate coverage on the date that employment ends -LRB- though this is increasingly rare -RRB- . Any employee who is resigning or being terminated from their job should ask for a clear answer as to how long their coverage under the group 's existing health plan will continue . This is especially true of people who work for small businesses that do n't have a Human Resources department , personnel policies such as we are discussing here often get established as a consequence of implementing the group 's health insurance for the first time and it may be years later that your event is occurring and the original office administrator may have long since left themselves and the business owner may not recall what they said they wanted their policy to be in this regard .

But with the Accidental Death rider it would pay 2 times that amount , or $ 200,000 , if your death was due to an accident of some sort .

{"input": "Does Basic Life Insurance Cover Accidental Death? ", "output": "Every life insurance policy covers accidental death . Traditional life insurance policies provide full coverage -LRB- paying out proceeds in the event death occurs by illness or injury -RRB- . Partial coverage policies only covering accidental deaths are known as Accidental Death & Dismemberment life insurance programs .

If you only have an AD&D policy and you die due to a heart attack , the policy would not pay out any proceeds because that would be considered death due to illness .

{"input": "How To Choose A Medigap Plan? ", "output": "Medigap plans are fairly straighforward as they have standardized benefits -LRB- e.g. meaning a medigap plan F from company ABC is the same exact plan F from company XYZ -RRB- . You can see the chart illustration of benefits in the Medigap guidebook on page 11 -LRB- free copies are available on the Medicare.gov website - I can e-mail a copy to you upon request as well -RRB- . Some of the big advantages of Medigap plans are that there are no networks -LRB- you can go to any doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare -RRB- and the policy is guaranteed renewable . Most people buying a Medigap plan will purchase a plan F or plan G as they create the most predictable healthcare expense structures . Plan F offers the most comprehensive coverage - it covers all Medigap benefits at 100 % from day 1 . The advantage of this plan is that it creates a very predictable healthcare expense structure -LRB- for the most part , you 're writing a check for your premium and you 're done - you wo n't get hit with big bills for any Medicare-approved charge -RRB- . Plan G is the second most comprehensive plan available - it 's identical to plan F except you would be responsible for the Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- . The advantage of a plan G is that in many areas the savings in premium per year are greater than the cost of the deductible . For example , if the difference in premium is $ 30 per month - you 're saving $ 360 per year by taking on a risk of $ 147 . The big factor to look at when comparing companies is the price of the plan you select . Remember - a plan F from one company is the same exact plan F from another -LRB- in short , why pay extra for the same coverage -RRB- .

Do you want a plan that covers most of the out of pocket expenses -LRB- i.e. deductibles , co-insurance , co-pays -RRB- ? "}
{"input": "How To Choose A Medigap Plan? ", "output": "You first want to research the types of benefits available under a Medigap plan , decide which of these benefits you want , and then select the Medigap policy that meets these needs . All of the Medigap plans are standardized so the benefits under a given plan is the EXACT same from every carrier . So how do they differentiate themselves in that type of marketplace ? They feature different rates , rating methods - community rated , issue age rated , and attained age rated , and value added services -LRB- e.g. UHC plan members can get discounts for vision or dental services and access to the senior sneakers program through AARP -RRB- . A lot of people think `` Why do n't I just get a plan F ? All of the benefits available are included in that plan ! '' While this is true , this plan is also going to be the most expensive . If you 're on a fixed income , you may want to try to keep your cost down . Therefore , a different plan may be more appropriate for you . For example , a plan G offers all of the same benefits as a plan F , except for the Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 for 2014 -RRB- . However , a plan G is going to be cheaper than a plan F -LRB- and usually by a good margin -RRB- . Plan N can also reduce premiums by a substantial margin and offer great coverage as well - the difference from plans F & G being a small copay is due when you go to the doctor -LRB- up to a $ 20 copay -RRB- or the hospital -LRB- up to a $ 50 copay -RRB- and excess charges are not covered . Plan N is most useful for someone who 's doctors accept Medicare and accepts assignment -LRB- when accepting assignment , a doctor accepts the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full and can not bill you an excess charge -RRB- . Another major point to keep in mind is where your health is now and where it may be in the future because you might not be able to switch to another Medigap plan later if your health drastically changed down the line , you may not be able to qualify for a new plan if medical underwriting is required . The rating method a carrier uses is an important factor to consider here . You also need to find out which carriers offer the plan in your area . Remember to keep in mind that not every carrier offers every plan . Because there are many health care plan options available to seniors , it 's most helpful for you to work with an experienced broker who can guide you through all of these steps .

{"input": "Can I Add My Parents To My Health Insurance? ", "output": "If you have individual health insurance the answer is definitely - NO . If you are covered under an employer 's group health plan the answer is almost always No as well . However , there is a very narrow circumstance where you might be able to add a parent onto your group coverage . I 've never seen it in real life but here 's how I understand it could be approached . First , you have to determine if your parent qualifies as a dependent under IRS guidelines . IRS guidelines say that if your parent is under age 65 , they have an annual income of less than $ 3650 and you pay more than half of your parent 's total support for the year you can claim them as a dependent . As you can see , these a some pretty hard criteria to meet but I 'm sure there have to be some people out there that fit this profile . Next , you will have to have a serious meeting with your employer and have family coverage available through your employer 's health plan . You ca n't add your parent as an individual . If your current coverage level is employee only you would have to change it to a level where two or more adults can be covered -LRB- e.g. - family coverage -RRB- . You must be prepared to provide documentation -LRB- tax filings , etc. -RRB- to your employer to support your request and , in all candor , I 'd visit with a family lawyer before meeting with your employer . It is highly likely that your HR person or the business owner has never been presented with this situation before and it 's such a rare situation that in some ways it defies common sense and is at odds with what is commonly accepted business personnel practices . Until your question prompted me to do some research my initial reaction was `` no way '' and I 've been in the business for 30 years .

{"input": "Does Owning A Trampoline Affect Home Insurance? ", "output": "Many companies refuse to issue a homeowners policy when there is a trampoline on the property . The trampoline is clearly identified as a hazard . Regardless of mechanisms to make them safe , there is still a high incidence of claims involving a trampoline . Companies that will insure a home with a trampoline will normally be considerably more expensive . "}
{"input": "Does Owning A Trampoline Affect Home Insurance? ", "output": "Trampolines are an attractive nuisance not unlike the pond on the back forty , They are the source of a lot of additional liability exposure to the policy and the homeowner . The biggest reason that liability increases is because more than one child or person is one the equipment at a time . Most families with a trampoline have n't established risk-based rules for use and enjoyment and so what looks to be a fun and exciting play thing , becomes a hazard teeming with potential to cause great bodily harm . Insurance companies know from experience that trampolines cause losses and are expensive to insure because the injuries can become catastrophic . Broken bones are one thing . A broken neck with paralysis is completely another but well within the outcomes on a trampoline . Add to the trampoline an almost complete lack of training or instruction on the correct methods of use -LRB- and the lack of appropriate rules for use -RRB- , and we find the trampoline becomes similar to a loaded gun just waiting for curious hands with just as much potential to destroy a healthful life . Another issue that crops us is the degradation of the platform fabric since it is exposed to weather and sunlight . People have been known to bust through the platform because it became degraded due to the sun and weather effects . Bones get broke hitting the found and frame members below the deck . In my experience , most companies do n't want anything to do with insuring a home with a trampoline . A relative few do n't charge additional premium and do n't restrict the presence of a trampoline . Others still will permit a trampoline when it is is present for coverage at an additional charge . One carrier we represent charges an additional $ 75 annually for the trampoline , requires the fences to be installed -LRB- most trampolines come with them -RRB- , and they wo n't provide insurance on the home unless the trampoline is also included in coverage . All in all , you do n't simply have the choice to not insure the trampoline since the mere act of having one dramatically increases the chances of having a loss ! That said , trampolines can be enjoyed safely but it requires careful and near constant monitoring by the responsible adults , the establishment of rules for use , the ability to protect the equipment from non-invited use by neighbors when the owner or their children are not using the equipment , and inspection periodically for signs of degradation and normal wear and tear . Additionally , basic skills should be discussed , taught and understood , limits should be placed on the behavior that is allowed on the trampoline , and responsible adults should be willing to stop all play when careful control can not be maintained . Many injuries occur when the parents are not paying attention or aware from the home . Let 's face it , no one wants to be sued for the liability that may arise out of an injury on a trampoline and no one wants to deal with the often catastrophic injuries that can occur to your children or the neighbors . These latter comments and insight are a good foundation for understanding why an insurance company does n't like trampolines and why homeowner insurance is often negatively influenced when they are present on the property .

{"input": "Why Is Renters Insurance Important? ", "output": "You may think that , because you do n't own a home , you do n't have anything at risk . Nothing could be further from the truth .

Liability coverage pays if you are deemed negligent and these lawsuits are seldom small and higher limits are extremely inexpensive . Be smart and find an agent you can trust . If it costs a little more , pay it . Choose your agent first , then listen to him/her . In the long run , you 'll save money . "}

{"input": "What Health Insurance Covers Lasik Eye Surgery? ", "output": "In the broadest of terms you should assume that a health insurance plan will not cover Lasik as it is generally viewed as an elective surgical procedure used in lieu of wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses . There are case situations though where the use of Lasik may be deemed medically necessary and the claim paid by the insurance carrier . Some examples might be the need for corrective surgery due to an accident or as a result of other surgery . Many health insurance carriers offer vision insurance plans as companion coverage for their individual and/or group medical plans . While these plans generally do n't cover Lasik in the vision plan 's scheduled benefits the quite often come bundled with a discount or flat fee arrangement for Lasik procedures as a value added benefit . As a result , some persons can or may have some discount arrangements in their existing benefit plans and some may not even really be aware of it of have forgotten about it . Check your coverage certificates and if you have a separate vision insurance plan - especially check those as that is where any possible benefit is most likely to show up . If your employer offers a medical Flexible Spending Account -LRB- FSA -RRB- and you are planning for Lasik in the coming year then you should definitely consider setting aside pre-tax dollars in a FSA to pay for your costs if you have no coverage at allor for after any cost sharing you might have through any coverage . FSA dollars can be used for a variety of out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by your insurance up to $ 2500 per year . So , when you know or are pretty confident you are going to have some level of out-of-pocket expenditure -LRB- s -RRB- for health care in the coming year you are essentially getting a discount equivalent to your tax bracket for the money you were going to spend anyways . Avail yourself of this option if it is available , if not , ask your employer to consider adding such a plan , it can be in the employer 's best interest from a tax perspective as well . Other than the obvious `` you pay for the whole thing '' option , this pretty well covers the spectrum for the non-coverage/coverage conditions for Lasik in health insurance and how the need is often addressed to some degree in many vision insurance plans .

{"input": "My 16 Year Old Son Wants To Start A Pet Care Business In Our Neighborhood. Should He (or I) Get Liability Insurance?

Just because he is 16 years old will not relieve him of the financial responsibility in the event of an occurrence where someone is injured or property is damaged . I do n't buy into the notion that insurance gives a business credibility but I do agree that it is the best single method of protecting assets and the future ability to earn a living . At 16 years old , another issue develops and that is whether or not he meets legal requirements to start or open a business or can entered into contracts . And , because your son is not of a legal age , will his parents or legal guardian be responsible for any losses that occur in the operation of the business ? If a case can be made for the inclusion of parents or guardians into a claim or lawsuit , the stakes just went up dramatically . So , insurance is a minimum necessity . One other thought . Insurance carriers may not insure your son because of his age , but they are more likely to concern themselves with the combination of his age and lack of business experience . Many carriers having the best rates have the requirement of at least a few years of experience . While coverage may be available in a specialty insurance marketplace , our best carriers will generally have issues with a 16 year old new business customer first entering and insuring a business . Once again , a parent might be necessary to make the business insurance happen . But back to your question : Absolutely a yes on the need for insurance . Good luck . "}

{"input": "What To Consider When Buying Life Insurance? ", "output": "Some things to consider when buying life insurance are : 1 -RRB- The guarantees .

If you want to use it for cash value or have a permanent need , you need universal life or whole life . If you are looking for inexpensive coverage for a temporary need , term insurance fits the bill . 4 -RRB- Whether you want to pay it over a limited period of time , or for the duration of the policy .

{"input": "How Many Years Of Term Life Insurance Should I Get? ", "output": "How many years of term insurance you should get depends on what you want the coverage for and for how long .

{"input": "How Many Years Of Term Life Insurance Should I Get? ", "output": "The number of years of Term Life Insurance you should get depends on your age and the needs you are trying to cover . Your health , build , smoking status and existing coverage may also enter into your decision . Age and Needs : E.g. . If you are a young person with young children , you will probably want at least 20-30 year term insurance . At a young age you will get a great rate , and that way you will have the premium locked in until your children are on their own . If you are older , you may want to take a shorter term because your premium is higher and your children are almost grown . This is just one example of how age and needs enter into your decision . Health : If you have a chronic health condition , it is a good idea to lock your term rate in for as long as you can afford -LRB- as long as you have a need for coverage that long -RRB- . Even if your health condition remains controlled , just developing one more health condition can cause your rates to jump very high . While your health is stable is the time to lock in that rate for a long time . Build : Almost everyone who is overweight thinks they will lose weight , and many decide to put off buying life insurance until that happens . Unfortunately , even if they lose weight , they have to keep it off for some time before it will lower their life insurance premium . And in the interim , their beneficiaries have no protection at all . A cost effective , wiser option -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- for those who think they will lose weight , is to take a short term policy now . At least then you have coverage , and if you never do lose weight , you can convert your term to permanent later on . On the other hand , if you are at an ideal weight now , again , lock that premium in for as long as you can . Smoking Status : This is similar to the weight issue . If you plan to quit smoking , you may want to take a short term policy now to save money . Existing Coverage : If you already have a long term policy locked in and just need additional coverage for a short time , you might choose a short term policy . You will want to look at what you have now before you decide how many years of Term insurance to add to your portfolio . These are just some examples to help you decide how long the term should be in the life insurance you choose . Give me a call if you 'd like me to help you decide in your situation . "}

When you get car insurance you get coverage for injuring third parties , which is typically called bodily/physical injury coverage .

If the legal defense costs are included in your limits you will have defense costs until the insurance company pays out the limits of your insurance . If you have a separate limit then your legal defense ends when the attorneys fees use up that allocated amount . Either way you do n't have unlimited defense , but if it is a serious bodily injury you will lose the `` free '' attorney much quicker . I hope this helps ! "}

{"input": "Why Does Life Insurance Underwriting Take So Long? ", "output": "Usually it is because the insurance company is waiting for information .

{"input": "Why Does Life Insurance Underwriting Take So Long? ", "output": "If you are applying for a policy that requires an exam , there is the chance that the underwriter will want to see your medical records . As an impaired risk life insurance specialist , I have seen several cases take nearly 6 months due to the complexity , amount , and elusiveness of those applicants ' medical records . This is what I have learned , to help speed up the process . 1 -RRB- Put all the doctors you have seen in the past 5 years on your application , and include the doctor who diagnosed your most serious health conditions . Delays often happen because records are received , but then the underwriter notices that the patient was referred to someone else during that time . Getting all your doctors noted at the start does not necessarily mean the insurance company will order records from all of them , but at least it gives underwriters the opportunity to pick and choose which ones they want , so they order them in a timely manner . 2 -RRB- Do your exam quickly . Putting of an exam for months sets back the whole application process . Sometimes medical records are not even ordered until the exam is done . 3 -RRB- Warn your doctor or clinic that they will be getting a request for your medical records , and ask them to fill the order ASAP . You might even want to collect your own medical records to speed things up , if that is allowed . 4 -RRB- Provide additional details in a timely manner . Sometimes insurance companies will see something on your MIB or MVR or application that will cause them to need more information . Answering that extra question , filling out that extra form , or doing whatever needs to be done , can eliminate unnecessary delays . 5 -RRB- Do n't jump to another company without talking it over with your agent first . Give him/her a chance to find out where the logjam is , and get it cleared up . If you can not get answers from your agent , it 's OK to switch , but close your first application out , or transfer it to someone else . Otherwise , you may end up applying for the same policy with two different agents , and that can cause further complications and delays . "}
{"input": "Why Does Life Insurance Underwriting Take So Long?

At our agency , we have an in house Case Manager who can order medical records , which helps cut down time in underwriting .

{"input": "Why Does Life Insurance Underwriting Take So Long? ", "output": "I am so glad you asked this question . Life insurance is an underwriting-driven sale . A well-managed underwriting process will yield both good pricing and good service . This is what you need to keep the client satisfied . The underwriter has the final word . At the same time , the client , the broker , the general agent , the case manager and the underwriter all collaborate in making things happen . In addition , third-parties such as physicians offices , and advisers such as accountants and attorneys and bankers , all have a role to play . Let me give you some examples of how things could work the right way , and also the wrong way . The right way can get you an approval in a matter of weeks . The wrong way can drag it out to months and months and months . First of all , you as the client must go through full disclosure . Answer every question thoroughly and accurately . Make sure you get prequalified so that any underwriting challenges are addressed before you submit a formal application . You might have to clarify elements of your medical history . You might have to give details on risky activities such as mountain climbing a scuba diving . Amendments to physician records may be needed . If all this information is collected up front , then you can benefit in two ways . First of all you can be confident that you have both competitive and reliable quotes . Your application should be approved at the rate quoted . In addition , the underwriting process should run more smoothly because a number of underwriting requirements have already been obtained . If you dont get prequalified , and underwriting challenges are not addressed before hand , then all the time needed to do so will delay the formal underwriting process . It is also important to get the insurance exam completed quickly . Those lab and test results are essential to evaluating the level of risk you present . It may be that your blood chemistry is off the day you take the exam , and that might raise some questions . You might even have to repeat the exam . Or clarification may be needed from your doctor . Better to take care of these items sooner rather than later . The longer you wait in scheduling that exam , the longer the evaluation will take , and the longer it will take to remedy any emerging issues . Medical records are also a dealmaker or a dealbreaker . They too play a huge role in assessing risk . These days many physician offices are short-staffed and overloaded with bureaucratic insurance company and government requirements . They often contract with services to make copies of records . Their turnover of requests for copies of files is often slow . Bear in mind that they are paid in advance and well paid for this service . You as the patient may have to get involved to stress the importance of a faster turnaround . Many times , statements and documents from professional advisors are needed . In one case I have , I obtained a medical approval of great pricing over six months ago . However , copies of trust and buy sell agreement documents are required to get the final approval , and to issue the policies . The attorneys and accountants still havent delivered . General agents play a key role in delivering customer satisfaction . Brokers typically do not deal directly with underwriters - we deal with general agents who operate at the wholesale level . A general agent who has strong leverage with carriers will be able to deliver underwriting concessions . He or she will also be able to intervene as needed and advocate on behalf of the client and broker if snags pop up during underwriting . Things can happen . Sometimes one underwriter will prequalify a case , and another will formally underwrite it . These two may not agree on what the price should be . The general agent needs to stay on top of this and get the dispute resolved as quickly as possible . Case managers are also key . These are personnel inside general agencies who expedite requirements . If they are really on the ball , then the broker is notified promptly of the need for outstanding records , documents , client information , etc. . If they are slack , then requirements are filled too slowly . I think too many agencies just rely on software to give updates . This technology is useful ; at the same time , managers really do need to stay involved personally with cases and move them along . It takes the personal touch . In essence , with the right team approach and cooperation from all involved , then things can happen relatively quickly . The broker needs to treat underwriting as such and provide proper direction . Without this leadership , there is so much room for error that underwriting can become a nightmare . "}

Typically , life underwriters gather information regarding the risk of insuring a person 's life through more than just the application .

Many doctors utilize services to copy the records & send them to the requesting party , while others do this `` in house '' . On occasion , we have had to have the insured called their doctor 's office to get them to release the records . Sometimes , obtaining medical records could take 30 - 60 days , resulting in longer underwriting times . "}

The issue with a policy that matures while the insured is still alive is that the maturity benefit will be taxable as the cash is constructively received at that point . Many policies in recent years have maturity extension riders or policy provisions which can extend maturity to prevent such an unwelcome situation so check your policy . Death benefits are normally received income tax-free but a living maturity is income taxable to the extent of gain in the contract to the policy-owner .

{"input": "Is Whole Life Insurance A Good Investment For Kids? ", "output": "That is an excellent question !

That said , it is a very common event that the amount of premiums paid are far less than the payout when it happens , but the insured is n't there to gain from it , as it only pays out when they pass . I 'd say that they are theoretically more like a savings account than an investment , as they are an excellent way to get cash when it might otherwise not be loaned to you .

{"input": "Will Annuities Increase? ", "output": "The challenge to answering the question `` Will annuities increase ? '' is that the answer depends on the context of the question . I will provide an answer for different situations and if you would like further clarification you can contact me . In Canada , there are basically two type of annuities , immediate and deferred . Immediate annuities provide an income in exchange for a lump sum . With a deferred annuity , the income is in the future , Deferred annuities are often used as an accumulation or investment vehicle . When the investment options are guaranteed , it is similar to a guaranteed investment certificate , GIC , and could increase through interest growth . In Canada , variable deferred annuities are often referred to as segregated funds or seg funds . These are similar to mutual funds and their value can increase or decrease depending on the fund -LRB- s -RRB- performance . Since they are issued by insurance companies , seg funds do offer minimum death and maturity guarantees , typically 75 % or 100 % . Some companies also offer resets or the locking in of gains , the full details of which are outlined in the plan 's information folder . One major factor in determining the income provided from immediate guaranteed annuities is long term interest rates . If rates increase , the amount of income provided will also increase . The income from an immediate annuity can also increase after issue depending on the terms of the contact . An indexed annuity for example can provide for an increase in income each year . Another option would have part of the income dependent on the performance of a fund or pool of funds , where the income would increase or decrease depending on the funds ' performance .

{"input": "How can I find out if my Mom had a life insurance policy that we could access to help pay for health care now? ", "output": "You 're referring to what 's known as an `` Accelerated Death Benefit Rider '' -LRB- also commonly referred to as `` Living Needs Benefit Rider '' or simply `` Accelerated Benefit Rider '' -RRB- . This rider is designed to allow a person to access a percentage of the proceeds prior to death if the insured person has been diagnosed with a terminal illness by her physician -LRB- some policies cite remaining life expectancy must be 12 months or less others may be 6 months or less - varies by insurance company -RRB- . The Accelerated Death Benefit Rider is included in most policies these days at no charge - if you 're unsure if it 's in her policy , you can contact the carrier to find out if it 's included in her coverage . Please note , when the rider is activated , there can often be a fee due for activation . The rider provides funds prior to death to be used for medical care , funeral arrangements , and other items and features an interest rate charged to the amount provided . Upon the death of the insured and a claim is made on the policy , the proceeds paid to the beneficiary will be the face amount less the amount provided prior to death and the interest generated from the loan . Another avenue is cash value if it 's a permanent life insurance policy -LRB- whole life or universal life insurance -RRB- - this money can be borrowed against the policy as a loan . However , it 's expected to be paid back . Should the death of the insured occur prior to repayment , the outstanding balance and any interest due would be deducted from the face amount and the difference paid to the beneficiary . If she is not terminally ill and is in need of long-term care , then you would be looking to determine if she has a long-term care insurance policy in place or a life insurance policy with a long-term care rider and what the benefits are under those programs . If you 're unsure if there are any existing policies on her and are trying to determine whether she has any coverage in place , the Medical Information Bureau -LRB- MIB -RRB- may be able to help identify a carrier she has applied for coverage with in the past -LRB- however , I believe they can only go up to a 7-year look back -RRB- , but due to privacy laws , she may need to do that herself . If you have documentation noting your authorization to review her input , then you may be ok on that matter . Otherwise , you may need to review past financial documents to determine whether she 's been paying premiums for a policy -LRB- e.g. input can be found via her bank statements -RRB- . If you know what carrier she has her coverage with , you can contact them to determine whether any of the above items are available under her policy . Please note , you would need authorization to do so or at the very least have her on the phone with you - due to privacy laws . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with coverage and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much . "}

{"input": "Where Can I Find More Income In Retirement? ", "output": "There are several steps that a retired person can take to increase their income . The first is to unretire . Retirement is overrated . Working has positive effects on a person and when the work is meaningful it can add years of enjoyment . It can certainly stretch your retirement budget . Even before you retire you can discuss this with your employer to determine if there is some way you can return to the workforce as either a consultant or contract worker . It would be best to determine which aspects of your work you enjoy and what type of projects you want to do . Enter into an agreement to work on those things that interest you . I know a teacher who shows up two periods of day to teach Physics and then gets in his car and drives home . He enjoys what he does and doesnt want to participate in the wider campus life . Sometimes it isnt possible to continue to work for your current employer . In those instances make an inventory of work in which you excel . Armed with that list contact people who need full or part-time help in your area of expertise and offer your services , or contract for your services . If you can not find an employer who needs your talents consider working for yourself . There are a variety of ways to advertise your skills and there are people looking for your talents . If you want to try something altogether new there are franchise opportunities available . These opportunities run the gamut from stores to on-line services and sales . Finding a program that suits your capabilities and temperament should be relatively easy . Some of these opportunities can become quite lucrative . I have clients who are leaving their employment long before retirement because their on-line sales business is flourishing . Obviously working provides income and it also reduces the number of years that you will depend upon your retirement savings to provide income . If you are drawing retirement income this will give you money which you can put into a Roth IRA to fund the period when you finally do stop working altogether . One of the most important things that working does is to allow you to delay receiving social security . For a long list of reasons it is usually to a retirees advantage to delay the start of benefits until they reach age 70 . The increase in benefits is substantial to the worker and to the widow it is amazing . Working provides a great deal of emotional satisfaction and a sense of freedom . Another technique to increase your retirement income is to tap into the equity of your home . Regardless of whether the mortgage is paid or not , you can take out a reverse mortgage after age 62 . A reverse mortgage will allow you to tap the equity in your home . This is a complex transaction and the only transaction that I can think of where an applicant must be counselled by a disinterested party . It is the right move for some , though and could make your retirement more comfortable . Another way to stretch your retirement dollars is to determine what you own of value that you no longer need . If what you own can be converted to cash it might help stretch your retirement income assets . Selling things on the internet is relatively inexpensive and can be quite fruitful . I advertised an accordion on the internet and was besieged with interested buyers . Estate sales demonstrate that there are things that are not being used by the retirees that are of interest to the public . Often cars are no longer being used , undeveloped land lies idle and jewelry lies unused in a safe deposit box . Another way to stretch your retirement income is to determine what services are available to seniors in your location that cost you money currently . Many places offer discounts and sometimes services can be free . Even utilities companies participate in programs to lower costs for seniors . With almost 50 % of retirees depending on Social Security for their retirement income it is very important to understand how you can stretch that income and even increase it . "}

More and more people are becoming worried that they will not have enough in the bank to live out retirement like they 'd hoped .

Some simple steps ? 1 . -RRB- Eliminate as much debt as possible now . Eliminating interest on loans , credit cards , etc. will save you tons of money later on . Tightening the belt now and paying off those debts will free up cash later , when it 's needed . 2 . -RRB- Look at when you want to file for your SSI benefits to begin . If you or your spouse can hold off on starting the benefits , the payments when they do start will be larger . 3 . -RRB- Eliminate unneeded expenses , and downsize where possible . If you are living in a home that has become larger than you need , maybe downsizing the home or property could provide the money that makes the difference . 4 . -RRB- If there is available money to invest , then look at vehicles that might help down the road - annuities , or a Roth IRA that allows later distributions might be options . 5 . -RRB- Work , or making money off of hobbies is always a possibility . If you like to garden , grow vegetables to sell , or make flower arrangements , etc. that both gratify you , and add income .

There is a commission in Washington currently debating if there will be a federal long-term care program , but they will have no power to institute one and it 's doubtful that given our current budget deficit , a comprehensive program could be afforded by either the states or the feds -LRB- Medicaid is a jointly funded and administered medical program for the poor -RRB- . Private long-term care programs at this point in time consist of applying to an insurance company and going through full underwriting to determine insurability . If so , they are issued a long-term care policy of insurance . Only insurance agents that are certified to sell long term care -LRB- most states -RRB- can do so . There is a Partnership long-term care program in 36 states -LRB- plus charter Partnership programs still going in CA , CT , NY , and IN -RRB- . The state departments of health `` partner '' with the person with a Partnership-approved long-term care plan of insurance so that if they blow through the insurance policy maximum benefits and are still alive , the amount of the payout from the insurance company will increase the impoverishment threshold dollar-for-dollar for that person and if the insured 's personal non-exempt assets are lower than what the insurance company has paid out , Medicaid will take over payment of the person 's long-term care costs until s/he dies.Note that there are some limitations1 . The person needs to be in a facility for full payment of costs by Medicaid . -LRB- Home care reimbursement from Medicaid is under $ 300/mo . -RRB- 2 . A lien in the amount of money paid out by Medicaid is levied against the patient 's estate . -LRB- This is currently being debated and is a point of contention with some states and consumer groups . Whether it will actually be done is not certain , but it 's `` on the books '' . -RRB- 3 . While there is a promise that no discrimination will be made between `` Medicaid patients '' and `` paying patients '' in nursing facilities , audits of some facilities have found that there are , in fact , `` Medicaid rooms '' and regular rooms . When discovered , those facilities are supposedly ordered to make no distinction in treatment , care , or placement of patients based on their ability to pay.At this time , it is clear that there is a looming problem of how to take care of the elderly of the boomer generation as that demographic bubble passes through old age . And , though medical technology allows people to live longer , that life is not necessarily better . No solution has yet been proposed at the federal level . The problem will fall to Medicaid for now . Recent surveys have shown that only about 7-8 % of the population owns its own long-term care insurance .

{"input": "Why To Buy Long Term Care Insurance? ", "output": "The reason people buy Long Term Care Insurance is so that they have the resources to pay for home health care , assisted living care , nursing home care , or some other types of care that are needed if they are unable to take care of themselves independently . Some people with large estates get Long Term Care insurance because they do not want all their hard earned money or property go to paying a nursing home . Rates of $ 100,000 per year are not uncommon for skilled nursing care . In order to qualify for Medicaid to pay these expenses , resources must be spent down to almost nothing -LRB- if a spouse is at home , the spouse does get to keep half of the couple 's resources -RRB- . So having Long Term Care insurance to pay for these costs both helps preserve the estate and assists the spouse left at home , if applicable . One aspect of Long Term Care insurance that is not always considered is the freedom of choice that is offered to persons who carry insurance to cover chronic care expenses . If they have the right type of coverage , they can pay a relative to come live with them or choose home health care , if that works . If they must go to a nursing home , they have more choice in the facility they want to live in , versus having to go with the room arrangements or facilities that only Medicaid will cover . This is not to say that Long Term Care Insurance is for everyone . If you have very few resources and are already on Medicaid , or anticipate getting Medicaid benefits in the future , there is no need to purchase Long Term Care Insurance . And if you need to dip into grocery money , forego medical care , or lead a poor quality of life to pay for LTC insurance , that is not worth it . Consulting with agencies that can shop for these policies to get you the best rate , and also guide you through the decision whether and what to buy LTC insurance , is a great place to start . "}

{"input": "Is An Annuity Right For Me? ", "output": "David 's article is well written and the basic principles are the same in Canada , the design and tax regulations and advantages are of course very different . Accumulation annuities : Guaranteed Interest Annuities -LRB- GIA -RRB- - your money invested is guaranteed Guaranteed Investment Annuities -LRB- GIF -RRB- also referred to as segregated funds or variable annuities - your money is invested in equities and is not guaranteed . Since the products are issued under the insurance act they include maturity and death benefit guarantees , typically 75 % or 100 % . Payout annuities : You exchange a lump sum of money for a stream of payments for the rest of your life or for a specified number of years . Since they provide a guaranteed pension income they are often used by retirement income planners to cover fixed expenses . The guarantees , estate planning applications , potential creditor proofing and tax advantages are reasons why annuities are an important part of retirement planning . In Canada as in the USA , whether or not an annuity is right for you depends on your individual circumstances . Using an annuity strategy is not always complicated , it is however , often permanent . In most provinces in Canada , almost anyone can call themselves a Financial Adviser or Financial Planner . Look for an insurance broker with a professional designation like a Chartered Life Underwriter -LRB- CLU -RRB- or Certified Financial Planner -LRB- CFP -RRB- . Annuities are often used in combination to increase after tax income , guarantee income , address volatility , `` lock in '' gains , leave a legacy , ensure privacy and provide potential creditor protection . With their increased risk exposure protecting your retirement nest egg is of special importance if you are the self employed .

{"input": "Is An Annuity Right For Me? ", "output": "There is a calculator available on the internet called the Living to 100 calculator . Medical science is steadily increasing the life expectancy of the general population . If the calculator shows that you can expect to live past normal life expectancy , an annuity is going to make awfully good sense . An annuity is a contract with a life insurance company to exchange a sum of money for a lifetime of monthly payments . There are variations to meet your specific situation . If you are in pre-retirement an annuity can be used in most tax qualified plans . In these plans your risk tolerance should guide you to a specific plan that allows you to leave all the investment decisions to professionals or handle them yourself . The key is that the deposits in the annuity are a transfer of capital from current consumption to future consumption . The results of the annuity while important are not nearly as important as the decision to move assets from the present to the future . An annuity does this quite well . An annuity can also be purchased outside a qualified retirement plan . While losing some of the tax advantages of the qualified plan , the annuity still accumulates money free of current income tax and allows the owner a great deal of flexibility in drawing the annuity down . An annuity addresses the issue of excess withdrawal risk by making regular payments without the ability to raid the bank . Since excess withdrawals have ruined many retirement programs this is a very important issue . The monthly check is like a paycheck and the retiree learns to live within their means . An annuity addresses the frailty risk in that it is already established before the retiree becomes frail . It is very simple to negotiate and the retiree will not require any professional assistance to use the annuity . In the same vein it addresses the issue of Financial Elder Abuse because in most cases no one can access the funds , not even the annuitant . Other than a variable annuity , most annuities are not subject to market risk . Once the annuity starts to make monthly payments , they will continue for life regardless of the performance of the market . Annuities are also not involved with Interest Rate Risk Annuities can be established in such a way to efficiently handle the unexpected loss of a spouse . The annuity can be set up to pay the same or a reduced benefit for the lifetime of the surviving spouse . An annuity can be an efficient way to reduce stress in retirement . The results are predictable ; it doesnt require anything from the annuitant and will be there as long as the annuitant survives . An annuity is a contract that is executed outside the estate and can pass directly to the beneficiary without the time consuming probate procedures . This can provide cash for paying estate taxes or final expenses . An annuity is a very important part of the retirement income plan . It has its own tax regulations and may be instrumental in keeping taxes at a manageable level . The key is that it is a financial product that blended with others gives the diversification a retiree needs to handle the changes that they might experience . "}

{"input": "Is AD&D The Same As Life Insurance? ", "output": "Great question ! And the answer is no ! Many people believe that an AD&D policy is a cheap way to insure themselves if they were to pass , but these policies most often do not cover any form of death by illness , and often have strict definitions of what an accident is . For example , you are bitten by a spider , and the bite causes an allergic reaction that kills you . The bite certainly was n't intentional on your part , but does n't qualify as an accident in most cases in the eyes of the insurance company . There would be no payout in this case .

{"input": "Is AD&D The Same As Life Insurance? ", "output": "No , AD&D is not the same as Life Insurance . Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance only pays if death is cause by an accident , or if a limb is lost due to an accident . It will not pay if a person dies from illness or old age . Even if the accident is cause by illness -LRB- e.g. getting in a fatal car accident while having a heart attack -RRB- , an AD&D policy will generally not pay the death benefit . Life insurance pays for death cause by illness or by accident . Since most death occurs by natural causes , more death benefits are paid , and the policy has a higher premium than AD&D .

{"input": "What Does Life Insurance Cash Value Mean? ", "output": "Whole life insurance policies also known as permanent insurance along with some other types of products such as universal life insurance build up a cash value after the insurance has been in force over an extended period of time . The cost per $ 1,000 of coverage is more expensive than term insurance and part of the premium is credited to the insureds cash value account . Keith Prim Dallas , TX 214-435-0791 "}
{"input": "What Does Life Insurance Cash Value Mean? ", "output": "Permanent life insurance , such as whole life and universal life are comprised of two parts . One part is the pure insurance , or death benefit . The other part is the cash or accumulation account . When you pay your premiums , part of your premium goes to pay for the death benefit , the internal cost of insurance . The remainder is credited to the cash or accumulation account -LRB- minus a small expense deduction -RRB- . This account grows by additions from the insurance company in the form of interest or dividends . Universal life policies earn interest while whole life policies are paid dividends . This interest or dividend is dependent on the performance of the insurance company 's investments and can change year to year . Just like any other accumulation account , the larger the amount the faster it grows . So , at the beginning of the policy it grows rather slowly and , as the account receives more deposits it , grows more quickly . With life insurance , you wo n't receive a 1099 at the end of the year . The tax is deferred until you withdraw it . Then , the withdrawals are considered paid premiums first , until you 've withdrawn as much as you 've paid in . Only after that will withdrawals be taxed at your current income tax rate . This tax deferral is one of the great things about life insurance . You also have the ability to take a loan against the cash value in your life insurance , usually at a very low rate and this does not trigger income tax . Lastly , for a long term need , permanent insurance is the least expensive way to purchase life insurance . Over time , the cash value will grow and will eventually be more than what you 've paid making it essentially free , or better . If this interests you , find a good agent you can trust and he/she will help you put together the right plan for you and your family . "}

{"input": "How Much Life Insurance Can I Afford? ", "output": "Life insurance can be designed to fit virtually any budget . It is definitely more affordable the younger you are so start early and do so before your ability to qualify medically changes . If your budget is tight , term insurance may be a place to start . For example , for about a dollar per day , a 35 year old in excellent health could buy $ 500,000 of 20 year term life insurance coverage . You can later convert it to permanent coverage , without having to prove you are insurable , when your budget allows for the higher premium . Then you can have coverage you can not outlive . "}

{"input": "Why Buy Medigap? ", "output": "Original Medicare -LRB- Parts A & B -RRB- only cover about 80 % of a senior 's health care expenses , leaving the insured responsible for the other 20 % . While 20 % does n't sound like a very big figure , it can add up to a nice big medical bill really fast . For example , if you had a procedure done that cost $ 10,000 and Medicare paid for 80 % -LRB- $ 8,000 -RRB- , you would be responsible for the other $ 2,000 of the bill - how many people can just get out their checkbook and write a check for that amount ? That number can be a lot higher too . The idea of a Medicare Supplement plan -LRB- commonly referred to as a Medigap Plan -RRB- is to cover the gaps in coverage that Medicare does n't pay for -LRB- e.g. that other 20 % -RRB- . You pay a monthly premium to get these gaps covered so you 're not hit with large bills . The resulting major advantage is it allows a senior to create a much , much more predictable health care expense structure - and when you 're on a fixed income , this is vital . A plan F is the most comprehensive Medicare supplement plan available in the marketplace today - plans C , G , and N are very competitive as well . "}
{"input": "Why Buy Medigap? ", "output": "The big reason to buy a Medigap plan is Medicare Part A & B does not cover everything by itself .

{"input": "Can I Put Insurance On An Automobile I Don't Own? ", "output": "In general , no , not for physical damage to the car . To insure property you need to have an insurable interest in the property you 're protecting . In other words , you have to have something at risk . If you do n't own it , what do you have at risk ? This why titling is so important . You could , theoretically , put insurance on a car you do n't own and not tell the insurance company that it 's not titled to you . Hopefully , your insurance agent is experienced and professional enough to ask who the car is titled to , but it does n't always happen . So , say you 've insured this car you do n't own and you get into an accident . You submit your claim to your insurance company to get your car repaired . One of the first questions a claims adjuster will ask is `` who is the car titled to ? '' . If the answer is n't you , you 've got a problem . The insurance company will only pay the registered owner of the car . They are the only party that has a loss . The only exception to this is if the car is financed or leased . In this case , the finance company will require , as part of the contract , to be listed as a loss payee . This entitles them to collect on the damage to that car . That 's how it applies to physical damage . For liability or injury , it 's different . Here , the insurance follows the insured . You could , theoretically , get liability insurance without owning the car you 're driving . Again , your agent will ask who owns the car , and they 'll believe what you tell them . If a claim happens for injury or liability , they will protect you , the insured . I do n't know why you 'd want to insure a car you do n't own , but I have an idea . It could be that a friend or relative is loaning you a car because you do n't have one of your own or it could be that a child , or someone else in your household owns this car but does n't want to , or ca n't , insure it themselves because they 're young and it 's expensive , or they have such a bad driving record they just plain ca n't get insurance . Either way , do n't get yourself in a situation where you have to lie to your insurance company or agent . If something happens , the truth will come out and you may not get anything out of it anyway . Be smart . Find an agent you can trust and be truthful with him/her .

The Simplified Employee Pension -LRB- SEP -RRB- IRA is probably your best bet.You can open one at virtually any bank , mutual fund sponsor or brokerage firm . Annual account fees are low - or non-existent . Your contribution limit is based on a simple formula : You can put away as much as 25 % of your net income , up to a cap that increases periodically to keep pace with inflation - $ 49,000 in 2010 . Money stays sheltered from taxes during your savings years , and what 's additionally appealing is a SEP 's funding flexibility . You can wait to fund the plan until you file your taxes . So if your income turns out to be higher than expected , you can make a large contribution and cut your tax bill . If you have a tough year , you can scale your contribution back.If you work alone now , but aspire to bigger things .

SEP rules can lock you into expensive contributions . With an individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- , unless that employee is married to you , you 'll have to stop funding your plan or convert it to the more complex and cumbersome employer version .

{"input": "Why Is Having Auto Insurance So Important? ", "output": "That is an excellent question ! I am asked all the time why `` I need insurance if I do n't need it '' . I always explain it like this - the whole purpose of protection is to help prevent a bad thing from being worse , right ? Throughout history we 've built fences , moats , armies , etc. to protect ourselves from a potential attack . Did those things get used every day ? Nooope . Once in a great while , but they were immensely helpful when they were needed . That 's the idea behind insurance . You may have years of safe driving under your belt without so much as a parking ticket , but you have no control over the chance that the guy coming around the corner towards you wo n't be coming from the bar , or texting away on his phone . When something like that happens , the insurance is a Godsend . Who has the money to settle a lawsuit or replace a totalled car , let alone repairs or a rental ? Having everyone required to have insurance evens out somewhat the odds that anyone is left unprotected in the event of an accident , and greatly increases your ability to pay for those repairs , replacements , rentals , or reparations , should they be needed .

If death occurs after the graded period ends , the policy pays the full face amount . It usually pays 100 % of the face amount from day one for accidental death . Some guaranteed issue life insurance policy premiums are guaranteed not to go up for life . Some can go up every year , and others are in between -LRB- e.g. can go up every 5 years -RRB- . Keep in mind that you will want to be able to afford this policy in the years ahead , and get lifetime guaranteed level premiums , if possible . Guaranteed issue life insurance can be a good choice for people who can not qualify for any other coverage . Even if death is anticipated within the first two years , the return is better than any savings account . And people are often able to survive serious diseases beyond what is expected . 2 -RRB- If by guaranteed life insurance you mean life insurance where the premium and face amount are guaranteed , it simply means that the premium can not go up , and the face amount can not go down , for a certain period of time .

An ILIT can offer many substantial advantages to protect life insurance proceeds . It can also help you distribute your property to your children at the least possible cost . If you have a taxable estate , you have a choice - pay the tax with your own money or pay only a fraction of the tax and use someone else 's money to pay the rest .

The life insurance policy may be secured for pennies on each dollar of tax that you owe . By putting the life insurance policy in an irrevocable trust , the proceeds become available to pay taxes due upon death . A life insurance policy that you purchase will require the same premium whether you put the policy in the trust or keep it outside of the trust . If you put the policy in the trust , the death benefit is not included in the calculation of the size of the estate . This is a huge tax savings , especially if the proceeds are several million dollars . If you keep the policy outside of the trust -LRB- e.g. , as owned by a natural person or a revocable trust -RRB- , the proceeds will be included in calculating the size of the estate potentially increasing the size of the estate by a big margin , and you may therefore have to pay much higher estate taxes before any of the property can be distributed to your children or other beneficiaries .

More recently auto insurance companies have begun offering this coverage as an option in their policies for leased vehicles . Talk to your Insurance Professional if you are shopping for a lease . You may find that adding the option on your auto policy is much less costly than having it included over the term of your lease agreement . "}
{"input": "Do I Need Gap Insurance On A Used Car? ", "output": "Gap insurance is a coverage that is offered either on your auto policy or through the auto finance company as an option -LRB- or requirement -RRB- on your loan . Basically , what it does is provide you a clean slate if you total a car with a loan on it . Lets look at an example : Erica buys a 2009 Volkswagon Jetta from a used car shop for $ 14,000 . The used car value could be 12,500 depending on what form you use -LRB- blackbook value , NADA , Kelly Bluebook value , etc. -RRB- The form doesnt matter here other than answering the question of is this car worth less than the loan I have on it ? Erica is required to have other-than-collision coverage -LRB- often called comprehensive coverage , which is a misnomer -RRB- and collision coverage as a stipulation for the loan she is getting with the bank or finance company . That coverage states that it will repair her car for specific reasons in the policy OR pay her the actual cash value of the car if it costs less than the repairs it would take to make the car drivable . Often a state variation will come here saying a car can not be repaired if the expenses are 70 % or more of the value of the car - the insurance company needs to pay the policyholder the actual cash value of the car instead . If you look closely at your auto policy , you also have a coverage to protect yourself from liability caused by you damaging the property of others . This is often referred to as property damage liability or the third number in your limits -LRB- such as 100/300/100 limits -RRB- . It states that it will repair the damage caused by your actions that you are held responsible for OR pay the actual cash value of that item if less than the cost of repairs . This is important , so remember it . So what does this mean for Erica , knowing this information ? Lets say Erica has had her Volkswagon Jetta for 3 years and diligently made payments on her car without missing a payment date . The loan is now $ 9,000 after interest . The value of the car has depreciated down to $ 7600 because of the age , mileage , and usage of the car . Technically , Erica is paying $ 1400 more on the car than what it is worth -LRB- taking interest out of the equation to make it easier . -RRB- Lets say at this 3 year mark , Erica gets into an accident and the car is beyond repair . It doesnt matter if she causes the accident or if someone else was at fault , because both property damage -LRB- what the other party uses to fix Ericas car if they caused the accident -RRB- and collision coverage -LRB- the coverage used to fix Ericas car if she caused the accident -RRB- use actual cash value to determine how much repairs will be made and how much money they will pay Erica . Both coverages will give Erica $ 7600 for her car . However , since Erica has a lien on the car because she is financing it , that money actually goes to the FINANCE COMPANY and Erica wont see a penny of it . The finance company will apply that $ 7600 to her loan , meaning there is a $ 1400 balance left she is responsible for . The bank isnt a charity so they will still tell Erica she has to pay it because it is still in her contract and the bank lost $ 1400 on a car that no longer exists . Erica still has to pay $ 1400 on a car she doesnt even have , and still has to buy a new car . Thats a bad place to be in life , wouldnt you say ? Even worse , Erica might still have to make payments even if the accident wasnt her fault ! She gets all of the blame of the finance company but caused none of the problems ! If Erica had gap insurance , it would kick in at this point and relive Erica of the extra $ 1400 she would be responsible for . If Erica was ahead of her loan and the cash value of the car was more than the loan , she would get any money paid above the loan amount -LRB- thus satisfying her finance company as well -RRB- and the gap insurance would not take effect . Either way , Erica isnt paying money any more on her car that is non-functional . Here are some common stipulations found in gap insurance - check with your loan company to see if they apply to you : Gap insurance is there to pay for the loan on the car and THATS IT ! If you increase the loan to pay for any extras you are typically not going to get that part of the loan covered and will still have to pay . This includes things like the extended warranty , credit life insurance in case you die before the loan is paid off , and things like that . It might even say the gap insurance isnt paid for either and you will have to pay for that . Its definitely worth looking into . Gap insurance also says that it wont take effect if you are behind on your payments on a certain amount , pay more because the car is worth less from overuse or modifications , and wont cover intentional damage to the car . Basically , its not there to handle your loan if you are financially strapped and can not handle the payments anymore and want to get rid of the car . Another option in place of gap insurance is to get the repair/replacement coverage for your auto policy . This says that instead of getting the cash value of a car beyond repair , you get a replacement car instead -LRB- even if it costs more than the value of the car . -RRB- You would still have the loan but youd have a car as well . This coverage might not be available and it often is only available for cars less than 1-5 years old and only if you are the original owner . Talk to your agent to see if you qualify . Gap coverage is an excellent coverage to get , and is worth the investment . Used cars typically drop in value faster than the loan does from payments , and you dont want to be stuck paying on a car you dont even have anymore . "}

{"input": "Does an insurance company have a duty to defend after the policy has been canceled? ", "output": "To properly answer this question I would need additional information . However , liability policies are written on either an occurrence basis or claims-made basis . If insurance was cancelled but was in force when the incident occurred , the company would be obligated to defend on an occurrence form . If the claim was filed after the policy was cancelled , the company issuing the claims-made policy would not be required to defend . However , in litigation plaintiffs seek relief from every insurance company remotely involved with the case . "}
{"input": "Does an insurance company have a duty to defend after the policy has been canceled? ", "output": "In a Business General Liability policy that was written on an occurrence form , if the incident in question occurred while the policy was still in force , the company on the policy would respond . If it were a claims made policy and you purchased a `` tail '' endorsement which would allow you to extend the period of time for making claims and the occurrence happened during the in force period of time of the policy and the claim was make after cancellation but prior to the end of the claims-made `` tail '' coverage period , the company would respond . If no extended period -LRB- tail -RRB- endorsement was purchased the claims made policy would not respond . "}
{"input": "Does an insurance company have a duty to defend after the policy has been canceled? ", "output": "The other respondents explain that two basic triggers exist within common liability coverage policies . It is important to realize that most personal insurance - auto , home , motorcycle , rv - are based upon the occurrence trigger in the insurance policy . An occurrence is an event including repeated exposures to the same condition , that cause loss covered by the policy . You 'll understand that if the loss `` occurs '' during the policy period , the loss is coverable and a duty to defend exists until such time as it is determined after further investigation that coverage is not provided by the policy . At that time the carrier would probably extend a `` reservation of rights '' letter to you to notify you that the investigation of the loss events are revealing to the carrier that the loss is not covered for some reason contained within the policy or due to the events that occurred . Nevertheless , if the loss `` occurs '' during the period the policy was effective , and barring exclusions and limitations , their is coverage in an occurrence policy . A `` claims made '' policy changes what triggers the benefits of the policy . In the case of claims made coverage , generally only written on business and professional liability exposures , the trigger is the event and when it occurred . What is different now is that the claims must be first made during the period of coverage or a subsequent policy . If a claim is permitted to be made on subsequent policies , the chain of coverage needs to be uninterrupted and the `` retroactive '' date for coverage to be set to a point before the actual date of the loss . Claims Made policies were designed to help eliminate the chance that years and years of coverage on an occurrence policy could not be stacked one upon the other to generate large amounts of coverage . In the case of claims made policies , only the current policy limit is exposed to loss and not a stack of limits from policies covering prior annual periods . One other point that is necessary to understand . Generally , there are limitations on how long after a policy is cancelled for a claim to be presented . Occurrence policies are much more accommodating here . On the other hand , claims made policies have a limited period of time after the policy ends for a claim to be made . This is referred to as extended discovery and extended discovery on otherwise unendorsed policies is only 60 days . That is , you only have sixty days to present a claim for coverage at the end of a claims made policy . Additional extended periods of discovery are available at additional cost but each carrier may have different periods of discovery available . This feature on a claims made policy provides the `` tail '' of coverage that an occurrence policy includes without additional charge . A `` tail '' is the time beyond the period of coverage where a claim may be first reported or appear on the books of the carrier . Liability type losses can have a long `` tail '' due to the nature of the coverage and potential loss . Property losses , on the other hand , generally have short `` tails '' where the loss is not known . The reserve that the carrier must maintain within its accounting for these losses is not as the IBNR -LRB- incurred but not reported -RRB- loss reserve . Over time the carrier reduces this reserve in recognition that the further past the end of a policy that they travel , the less likely a loss has occurred or will be reported . This should help you understand just how much must taken into account to answer your generalized question . I hope this helps answer your question . "}

{"input": "How Much Is Permanent Life Insurance? ", "output": "The smallest premium I have seen for a permanent life insurance policy is $ 15 . The highest is in the millions . The amount of coverage that you can get for any given premium amount depends on your age , health history , tobacco use , gender , height-weight , etc. . Your independent agent can give you rates for many companies and help you understand which companies will approve you . "}
{"input": "How Much Is Permanent Life Insurance? ", "output": "Unfortunately there 's too many factors that go into premium pricing to say what an average plan costs.The risk class is the most critical factor in determining the cost -LRB- premium -RRB- of a life insurance policy . The risk class depends ona number of factors including whether you 're male or female , your medical history , height/weight profile , any tobacco usage , and other factors . Keep in mind , every carrier has their own set of underwriting guidelines and mortality tables , and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred -LRB- featuring lower rates -RRB- and company B may only offer standard -LRB- featuring higher rates -RRB- . Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for the rest of the insured 's life and build cash value . Under a guaranteed universal life -LRB- GUL -RRB- program , the policy can be structured to keep premiums level and provide coverage up to a specified age -LRB- e.g. to age 90 , to age 100 , or even up to age 121 -RRB- under the `` dial down '' process . Whole life features level premiums and death benefits and builds cash value at a faster rate -LRB- participating WL policies may pay dividends that can be used to increase the death benefit or decrease the premiums over time - non-participating WL policies do not feature this ability -RRB- - the trade off between this and guaranteed universal life is that to increase the cash value faster , the premiums will generally be substantially higher . For both GUL and WL , the carrier takes back the cash value upon the death of the insured , and pays out the death benefit proceeds . Therefore , GUL policies allow you to maximize your death benefit and minimize your premium dollars that you pay for the coverage . Non-medical policies generally cost more than fully underwritten policies that require an exam because an insurance company is taking on more risk without having a full medical picture of you .

{"input": "if i have a universal life policy and the guaranteed side goes to zero at age 75 does that mean that I lose the death benefit at that age? ", "output": "No . The guaranteed side simply means the coverage is guaranteed to remain in effect until that point as long as the premiums are continued to be paid at their current rate - as universal life insurance is defined as flexible premium coverage , you have the option to increase the premium you 're paying to extend the guarantee side . The current side determines when the coverage would actually run out - however , the current side is always subject to change as it reflects whatever the current interest rates are . If the interest rates change , then the current side will change as well . In addition , if the carrier raises their costs of insurance charges under the policy , then the cash value can be depleted even faster thus lowering the current side coverage projection even further . If you 're unsure what you have , you can contact the carrier to send you an up-to-date illustration -LRB- a coverage projection citing how long the coverage will remain in force based on today 's figures -RRB- . It sounds to me as though the policy that you have is a current assumption universal life program rather than a guaranteed universal life program -LRB- which can guarantee premiums remain fixed and guaranteed up to age 121 -RRB- . Current assumption policies typically have limited guarantees under their programs and require additional premiums if the cash value is depleted - meaning they will `` crash '' if the cash value hits $ 0 -LRB- you would therefore need to pay more in premiums above what you 're already spending to keep the coverage going or else it will lapse -RRB- . Guaranteed universal life policies state that even if the cash value hits $ 0 , the coverage will still continue as long as your regularly scheduled premiums are paid . If you prefer to have something that guarantees coverage for life rather than risking coverage lapsing after age 75 , you may want to consider setting up a guaranteed universal life policy .

What that means is you can pay your premiums , skip your premiums , take money out , put money back , so without seeing what you 've done over the years with your policy it is hard to give sound advice .

That means if your 1 -RRB- interest rate dropped to the lowest rate right after you got the policy , and 2 -RRB- the cost of insurance went up to the highest rate right after you got the policy , you can still be assured your policy will last to age 75 . If the interest rate never drops that low , and the cost of insurance never goes up that high , your policy will probably last past age 75 ... maybe even much longer . Now , if you asking about whether your policy will lapse if the CASH VALUE drops to 0 at age 75 , then that is a different story .

{"input": "How Do I Get Cheap Car Insurance? ", "output": "There are two ways to measure whether an auto insurance policy is cheap . From the television advertisements you could think that the premium is the way to determine who has the cheapest insurance . Your state insurance commissioner is charged to make sure that insurance companies keep their promises . He does this by making sure that the premiums being charged are adequate . Since all insurance companies doing business in your state are offering their policies to the same group of people , it would seem that ultimately they would have pretty similar experience and would charge fairly similar rates . When you hear an advertisement telling you that customers saved on average 25 % by switching to company A , you need to understand that information like that is the result of after sales surveys . This is what people report . That is why almost every insurance company has similar advertisements . If everyone is saving money over everyone else , something isnt quite right . The other way to determine cheap insurance is to determine by value . You buy automobile insurance to pay claims when you have an accident or your car is damaged . When this occurs how much you paid in premium may be insignificant if the policy you hold on your automobile is inadequate to handle the law suits coming your way not to mention the repair of your vehicle . A few days ago a client was struck a glancing blow on the right rear of his car while stopped at a signal light . The car then proceeded to hit the expensive car stopped alongside my clients , pushing that car into a small car with two children on board which then rolled forward and knocked over and ran over a motorcycle operator . The driver who started this mayhem is not thinking about how much he paid in premiums , he is thinking about how much the company is going to pay in the costs that will come next . Incidentally , two people left the scene in ambulances and others were undoubtable injured . The way to have the cheapest automobile insurance is to secure the services of a competent insurance agent . The agent will listen to you , provide sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and with the insurance company . In the end the agent will guide you to appropriate limits . These limits will determine how well the insurance company performs when you have an accident . Regardless of which company the agent and you agree upon , the real test is going to be how well the company performs when you have an accident . There are two other fallacies that affect an automobile insurance purchase . The first is the idea of legal limits . If you purchase automobile on the basis of the limits required by law you may well bankrupt yourself when you have an accident . Those limits can handle some accidents but certainly will stop paying long before the bills stopping coming if the accident involves much personal injury or the car struck is expensive . The other fallacy is full coverage . Most consider full coverage to be enough to satisfy the state requirement and enough to satisfy the lender . While keeping those entities satisfied you are still assuming too much exposure personally . Your company could run out of money before everyone is satisfied . Then they will sue you directly . "}

{"input": "Where To Invest If Not Eligible For Roth IRA? ", "output": "The Roth IRA provides an ideal solution to many peoples retirement planning needs . Contributions are made with after tax dollars but taxation on the earnings is deferred and then forgiven upon reaching the age of 50 and a half . The plan must have been in effect for five years . These tax free dollars give the retiree tremendous leverage and flexibility . The Roth IRA is an essential part of many peoples plans . There are income restrictions that disqualify individuals and married couples filing jointly from establishing a retirement program using a Roth IRA . There is a phased out eligibility for Singles or heads of households earning between $ 60-70 ,000 annually or married couples filing jointly of $ 96,000-116 ,000 . and there are other restrictions . If a person is facing these restrictions and can not contribute to a Roth IRA there are several steps that can be taken . The first is to contact the plan administrator at their place of employment . It is a fairly simple matter to add a Roth option to existing 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and 403 -LRB- b -RRB- plans . These Roth 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and 403 -LRB- b -RRB- plans have all the benefit of a Roth IRA and the limits for participation are much higher making them ideal , particularly for highly compensated employees . The key is to determine if the persons future income tax rate will exceed the rate that is currently being charged . Many are surprised to find that when they stop paying on a mortgage and other deductible expenses that their income in retirement can be in a higher tax bracket than their current bracket . If there is not an option for a Roth 401 -LRB- k -RRB- or 403 -LRB- b -RRB- plan an alternative would be permanent life insurance . It is taxed in a similar way to the Roth IRA . The deposits are made with after tax dollars and the distribution can be free of income tax with some careful planning . The life insurance has the additional benefit of being self-completing should death interrupt the accumulation phase . Permanent life insurance comes in several styles which will match the investment options normally available to those who are interested in a Roth IRA . For the more conservative there is the totally guaranteed funding available in whole life insurance . The insurance company assumes all of the risk and steady growth is guaranteed . For the more adventuresome there are life policies in which the cash value is invested in a separate fund . This is normally administered by the insurance company but may have a better yield that the funds held in the companys general fund . There is another form where the detached cash value earns interest based upon one of several popular market indexes . These indexed universal life policies allow you to experience some of the gains of the market while often limiting the downside of the market . For those who want to experience the fluctuations and opportunities of the market there are variable life policies where the cash value is fully invested at the discretion of the policyholder . These policies have greater risk and potential rewards . "}

{"input": "What Does Life Insurance Do?

Typically , these benefits are used to pay final expenses of the deceased and any other unpaid bills -LRB- i.e. mortgage , auto loans , etc. -RRB- that they might have incurred during their life . There are different kinds of life insurance coverage . Some life insurance can be in force for a specified amount of time and then expire . Other kinds can build cash value , allow the policyowner to take out a loan against the policy or it can even become paid up and you 'll have it for the rest of your life and never have to make payments on it ever again . Premiums are the amount you 'll pay per month to have the coverage . This amount will vary based on the type of coverage you want , the amount of the benefit , the age of the insured , occupation , hobbies and so on . Term life coverage usually offers the lowest premuim . It provides coverage for a specified amount of time , usually 10 to 30 years and then it expires if the insured is still alive . If the insured does pass away during the coverage period , then benefits are paid to the beneficiary . Other coverages like whole life and universal insurance are generally more expensive , but depending on your long term goals , it may be a better option for you . "}
{"input": "What Does Life Insurance Do? ", "output": "In addition to what Daniel Graham posted , many newer Life Insurance policies offer living benefits as well as death benefits . Many policies have an Accelerated Death Benefit Rider . This will pay a percentage of the face amount if the insured contracts a terminal illness . This varies according to company . Some contracts also offer Long Term Care benefits and critical illness benefits . While Life Insurance was never meant to be an investment , it does create an immediate estate . If you put $ 100 into a money market for example , and you die the next day , your beneficiary would get $ 100 . If you pay a $ 100 premium on a new life policy with a face value of $ 100,000 and you die the next day , your beneficiary would get $ 100,000 . My point is that Life Insurance has a definite place in financial planning and with the living benefits many companies now offer , it is even more attractive . "}

Life insurance provides protection and security to families as it is the one thing that really can step in and help during a terrible time . It can provide temporary coverage for a momentary need . It can provide a life time of coverage and supplement retirement needs depending on what a person chooses to do with it .

{"input": "Which Are The Best Health Insurance Providers? ", "output": "Unfortunately , as a 30 year veteran of the health insurance industry I have to tell you there is no objective measure or rating that the consumer can refer to in attempting to answer the question `` Which Are The Best Health Insurance Providers ? '' . The herd has been thinned out considerably amongst health insurance carriers over the last 20 years and so you have your big national players life AETNA , Assurant , CIGNA , Humana , United Healthcare , WellPoint , state based Blue Cross/BlueShield plans and then more regionally based carriers like Kaiser . To be blunt , insurance carriers have become more of a commodity -LRB- some might argue public utility -RRB- these days than they would ever want to admit to . They are all copying each other and often using the same health care providers in their networks . So , while it would be incorrect to say they are all identical , the quality of care and customer service levels from the consumer 's perspective are very similar from one health insurance carrier to the next . From the health care provider 's perspective some health insurance carriers have reputations for being more aggressive in negotiating discounts and being easy or complicated to get paid by than other health insurance company 's do . But , even this can vary from state to state and change over time as health insurance carriers continually adjust to the changing environment . "}

Keep in mind that if you have assets in access of this amount , you risk those assets if you do not have coverage protecting the amount of those assets .

{"input": "Does Indexed Universal Life Insurance Work? ", "output": "Sometimes . The company controls the fees , the costs , the mortality charges . They send you a bill for it all .

Do n't fall for this trick . And remember there is the average return and then there is the actual returns . "}
{"input": "Does Indexed Universal Life Insurance Work? ", "output": "Yes , Indexed Universal Life Insurance works . If your goal is to build up cash value inside a life insurance policy that can offer financial flexibility later on , then it can work great . Universal life insurance accumulates cash inside the policy due to the success of a financial index such as the S&P 500 . Most companies give you choices of individual indexes or blends of several indexes and offer a `` floor '' of zero or 1 % . It is important to note that your money is NOT in the stock market . Interest is credited to your account if the referenced index goes up over a pre-selected length of time . Generally , insurance companies will put a cap on the amount of upside you can get because they are guaranteeing you no downside if the index goes down . Often , the caps can be 13 % - 17 % with blended index choices . Make sure you set reasonable expectations for what `` success '' is , though . Building significant cash value inside an indexed universal life insurance policy does n't happen over night . You should allow 10 to 15 years for accumulation for college education costs or a retirement income stream . And remember , even if you use the available cash build-up over the years , you still have the death benefit to pass on to your family upon your passing . As always , it is all about `` fit '' when it comes to financial products and Indexed Universal Life is no different . The design of the IUL is important and best left in the hands of an experienced , licensed financial professional . "}

Since they rarely pay the full increase demonstrated by the index there is enough room to make sure that they can meet their obligations . "}
{"input": "Does Indexed Universal Life Insurance Work? ", "output": "That 's a great question ! The answer really kind of depends upon how much work you want to put into it to ensure it works . This kind of policy requires that you pay attention to its performance , and that you do your part in looking for a policy that has the best cap rate , highest participation rate , minimal surrender fees , and greatest guarantees .

Yes , but this is not the type of policy that you can make minimum payments on and forget about , unless you 'd like to find out in a few years that it 's in trouble , and so are you.Especially if the market has been volatile , or taken a down turn .

{"input": "How Long Will An Insurance Company Provide A Rental Car?

In most cases , a policy will include coverage for a specific daily dollar amount , say $ 30.00 a day and up to a maximum dollar amount or number of days . Keep in mint that maximum is a policy maximum , not the guaranteed maximum for your loss . If you have that coverage , your claim professional will work with your repair shop in order to conclude how long you may need the rental car based upon parts availability and the shop 's work schedule . If the shop can get the work done and your car returned to you in 5 days that will be the length of time approved by your claims professional . If some un foreseen event changes that plan , your claims professional can modify the benefit payment schedule .

{"input": "Can The IRS Take Life Insurance Money? ", "output": "There is no income tax paid on life insurance benefits , in most cases . Life insurance does not go through probate if the beneficiary of the life insurance policy is a person . If the estate is large enough , estate taxes must be paid on life insurance . So in that respect , the IRS can take life insurance money , through applicable taxes . If you are asking if the IRS can take the proceeds of a life insurance policy if the insured person passes while owing back pay to the IRS , if the beneficiary is a person , the IRS can not take the life insurance money from the beneficiary .

{"input": "What Is The Best Health Insurance For A Single Female? ", "output": "The best kind of health insurance is the kind that is best for you . There 's a difference between the most comprehensive coverage and what is most suitable -LRB- or `` best '' -RRB- for you . Two questions that are helpful in pointing you in the right direction to find the plan type that 's best for you are : 1 -RRB- do you want the most comprehensive coverage you can get or are you willing to take on a larger share of the risk/costs to keep your premiums down ? 2 -RRB- what is your budget ? maximum dollar you 're willing to spend ? Under the new Affordable Care Act , there are four main benefit levels - bronze , silver , gold , and platinum . Platinum plans are going to provide the most comprehensive benefits , but will also feature the highest premiums . Not everyone will be able to afford a platinum plan , which is why bronze , silver , and gold are available as well . The idea being to reduce your premium , you take on a little more risk - meaning you 're willing to take on a higher deductible , higher coinsurance/copayment , etc. to keep your premiums down . You may also want to see if group coverage is available through your employer . Group coverage can provide many benefits as well , such as lower premiums -LRB- the employer contributes to a percentage of the premiums for each employees plan -RRB- - the trade-off to keep in mind is that for group plans , if you left the company or your employement was terminated , you lose the coverage . An individual plan will stay with you wherever you go . It 's always helpful to consult with an experienced broker regarding your coverage . We have in-depth knowledge of products from multiple carriers and work on a personal level with our clients and help them find the coverage that will best serve their needs . Let me know if you have any other questions . Thanks very much ! "}
{"input": "What Is The Best Health Insurance For A Single Female? ", "output": "Assuming you are talking about individual major medical insurance purchased after January 1 , 2014 , I think it comes down to some basic questions such as ; 1 -RRB- Do I qualify for a subsidy of my health insurance if I purchase it through the government health insurance marketplace ? The answer to this question may help you determine if you wish to purchase your coverage inside or outside of the government marketplace . In many areas of the country you will have more insurance carrier options outside of the government marketplace . 2 -RRB- Affordability - with or without a subsidy , what does your personal budget allow you to spend on health insurance premiums each month ? 3 -RRB- Plan Design & Cost Sharing - you will see a bewildering array of plan designs , many of which will look quite different from what you may have seen in the past . Terms such as Bronze , Silver , Gold & Platinum will need to mean something to you as they denote some basic levels of coverage and what you might anticipate in paying out of your pocket before your insurance benefits begin to pay . Bronze plans will offer the lowest monthly premiums but they will almost universally require you to pay a substantial deductible -LRB- perhaps $ 6000 + -RRB- before anything other than preventive care is covered . The trade off for a lower monthly premium can be more than offset by paying out of pocket for doctor 's services , inpatient & outpatient services and prescriptions . You will have to make some judgment call as to what you anticipate your health care consumptionwill be and how much up front financial exposure you are willing to take . If you are dealing with a chronic medical condition like diabetes you may be better served to pay a higher monthly premium for higher level plan designs that offer copays and lower deductibles . 4 -RRB- Provider Network - are the doctors , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use in the provider network for the insurance plan you may be interested in ? This is an especially sensitive area to women and one where you really need to do your homework . If you are purchasing coverage outside of the government health insurance marketplace you can be pretty confident that the providers the carrier says are in-network really are . There has been no small amount of confusion on this issue with some of the insurance plans offered in the government health insurance marketplaces . Also , you are more likely to encounter `` skinny '' networks in the government marketplaces than outside of them . The insurance products using skinny networks will generally be among the most attractively priced but the trade off is a significantly reduced provider network and possibly an environment more centered around Physician Assistants and/or Nurse Practitioners . 5 -RRB- Prescription Formulary - this kind of goes along with the points I was making above but it deserves special attention . You should not assume that every insurance carrier or even every insurance plan option offered by the same insurance carrier will cover the specific prescription medications you use . Every carrier uses prescription formularies -LRB- lists of approved drugs -RRB- and they can vary widely in what they cover , at what level they cover it , and possibly what steps you may have to go through before a specific medication would be approved for coverage . If you are using specific prescriptions you would be wise to verify their coverage status with a potential carrier before you enroll with them . 6 -RRB- Does Your Coverage Extend Beyond Your Local Area & Does it Require a Primary Care Physician Referral in Order to Visit a Specialist ? - some plan options may be restrictive as to the geographic boundaries of your coverage and may provide little or no coverage outside of their `` service ' area . If you are the stay at home type this may not be an issue for you but if you travel a lot is may be a serious factor in your decision . Also , you should not assume that you can just go directly to any specialist -LRB- even if they are in-network -RRB- without a referral from your Primary Care Physician -LRB- PCP -RRB- first . Some plans require a referral from a PCP to access specialty care . Without such a referral in these plans you may find your claim denied or treated as an out-of-network claim . You need to determine if the health plan you are considering uses such a gatekeeper approach and decide if this is acceptable to you . If you can do all these things then you will be well positioned to find a health insurance plan that best fits your needs . If you feel you are not equipped to find the answers to all these questions on your own then you should seek out an independent insurance broker to guide you through this process . "}

{"input": "When Will I Be Ready To Retire? ", "output": "Many consider an arbitrary age , such as 65 , as the time when they must retire . The better question is , when will I be ready to retire ? Planning towards that date makes better sense . Almost 40 % report that they started retirement at a date that they did not choose . This makes early planning very important . There is quantitative data that will be necessary to start this process . You should prepare a current financial statement so that you can identify your assets and your liabilities . A cash flow statement would show both your current income and spending habits . That would give you a good indication about your spending in retirement . It would also help you decide if your retirement objectives are realistic . You might be living on a modest income , but planning to retire in luxury . That might be difficult to accomplish . When you are looking at debt you need to identify those debts that will remain into your retirement . On the asset side you need to determine how much of those assets will be available once you retire . You probably have some assets that you dont think about such as cash value life insurance , the equity in your home , another home , or collections . Armed with this information you should seek professional help . If you are uncomfortable with that a visit to the local library will probably locate books that can help you evaluate things for yourself . If you do talk to a professional expect questions about your family , hobbies , organizations and other things that interest you . The next step , taken either alone or with a professional , is to identify and prioritize your retirement goals . It is often difficult to visualize what life will be like once you retire . You should , however , identify what activities you want to do when you retire . If you want to do wood working or golf or travel , these things have costs and need to be identified . Some activities that you enjoy today might be difficult when you retire . Many people want to leave a legacy . If you can establish now what you want to leave to charity or to your family that would be most helpful . If these can be funded early in the process it frees you to make decisions about your spending without worrying about conserving capital for a legacy . The three most pressing issues for most people are providing for a retirement that lasts longer than they anticipate , providing for their surviving spouse and the potential expense of long-term care . These concerns play an important role in your retirement plan and may even affect the date that you start retirement . Your cash flow statement should show what you are spending now . Those expenses will change somewhat and it is important to make those adjustments . Identify which expenses are absolutely necessary and which are discretionary . The way that you provide for basic expenses will be different from the way that you provide for your discretionary expenses . Remember that expenses are not going to remain constant over retirement . Inflation is a problem in retirement that results in increased expenses when the income is probably remaining the same . At the same time , with age comes reduced capability to engage in some activities and that might lower the cost of retirement . The next step is to identify the sources of retirement income . For most there will be social security . For a surprising number social security provides most or all of their retirement income . Perhaps you are fortunate and have a pension plan . Perhaps you have saved money for retirement in qualified or non-qualified plans . Armed with this information you can start to formulate a plan that will take you through retirement and help you meet your objectives . "}

If you are a billionaire , should you buy life insurance ? Sure you should . Lets suppose your estate would owe the government $ 100 million in taxes when you die . To pay this fee , your heirs might have to liquidate a bunch of businesses and buildings and other assets . They would then pay the bill dollar for dollar . Or , you could buy life insurance and pay the bill for pennies on the dollar . And keep all your assets intact as an inheritance for your heirs . Not only that : lets suppose you started a foundation to eliminate world hunger or some other noble cause . Lets suppose you wanted to leave the charity $ 100 million as a gift when you died . If you bought a life insurance policy and left that to the charity , you would only have to pay a few cents in premium for every dollar a benefit . You would have that much more money left over for other good causes . A very good use of your money . Now , lets suppose youre not a billionaire . Should you buy life insurance ? Heres the question : do you have a more economical way to take care of your family ? They have become dependent upon you . Why force them to reduce their standard of living when you die ? You could start putting money away into a fund . But what happens if you tragically died next year ? Would you have really accumulated enough money to let them live their lives ?

First , be sure you understand what happens to the coverage if you leave your employer . Most of these plans are not portable , and they terminate when you leave the company . For that reason , I would not look to these plans as a replacement for personally owned life insurance outside of your employer . The other issue is that contrary to conventional wisdom , payroll deducted life insurance may not be lower in cost than buying outside of work . Many of these companies who issue the coverage use a less stringent underwriting process , which may be a good thing if you are not insurable at the best rate classes . However , if you are in very good health , you will likely pay less for individual coverage than through payroll deduction . There 's also the term conversion benefit on personally owned coverage that you may not have on the voluntary policy . "}

Whole life provides coverage , as the name suggests , for the whole of your life , it does not expire like most term policies . Whole life policies usually have cash values which grow in a tax advantaged way . In addition , whole life can provide additional financial and retirement planning opportunities . With term insurance you pay for the coverage and in most cases that is what you get - life insurance at a specified price for a specified term . If you need coverage for the long term , then whole life could be better . If you need coverage for the short term , then term insurance could be better . Another product to consider is Universal Life which could be better . What policy is right for you depends on your individual situation .

{"input": "Why Is Whole Life Insurance Better Than Term? ", "output": "Better depends on available funds . Something is better than nothing . If you can not presently afford whole life , then getting term insurance is the smart thing . Getting whole life and not being able to afford it , may result in not paying the premium and being left with NO insurance . A reputable insurance agent will only sell you what you need AND can afford . Whole life never changes its premium , unlike term which will escalate at the end of the stated number of years . Also whole life builds up cash value . That value can be borrowed against , and not repaid , kept tax free , although it will lower the death benefit if not repaid . Whole life can eventually pay its own premium , from the cash value being built up . But be sure you can afford whole life at the beginning . Do not ever leave yourself with no insurance .

{"input": "Why Is Whole Life Insurance Better Than Term? ", "output": "That is an excellent question . You should be aware that there are times when a term policy makes more sense to have , but there are two points that make a whole life policy better than a term . The first is that a term policy ends . After that happens , you have to renew , or get another policy . If your health declined during the policies life , that may make it difficult to get another policy . In any event , your increased age will cause the new policy to be more expensive . A whole life policy ends when you do . your health can decline , and it has no effect on your locked in payment . The second is that term policies have no value , other than what the face amount is should you pass . A whole life policy will generate a fund of cash that can be borrowed against , should you ever need . I hope that helps . Thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "Why Is Whole Life Insurance Better Than Term? ", "output": "I would not say that whole life is better than term life . It really depends on the clients need for life insurance . Whole life insurance name is literal , it is a face amount of life insurance that will last your whole life at a fixed premium . It is typically more expensive than term when your young therefore the face amount is typically less than a term insurance counter part . It is however much more affordable in later years because of the fixed rate . Term life insurance is typically more affordable in younger years with a fixed time period of level premiums such as 5-10-15-20-30-35 years . Term life insurance is used to cover a time period of debt such a mortgage . For example you purchase a home with a $ 250,000 mortgage for 30 years . It would be prudent to purchase a $ 250,000 30 year term policy as well . Try to avoid mortgage life insurance unless you are uninsurable . This term is known as decreasing term life and reduces as the mortgage is repaid . With straight term life , your loved ones will receive the difference of the face amount instead of the insurance company . "}

{"input": "Can You Get Insurance That Will Provide You An Extended, Paid Maternity Leave From Your Job?

Now , as to obtaining an `` extended , paid maternity leave from your job '' , you seem to be asking on whether there is a way to buy an extended period of benefit for a group , employer sponsored medical or disability income program . I have not encountered this option as a benefit in 38 years of work in this industry but , the best option is to contact the benefits administrator or Human Resources at your employer with this question . No optional benefit available will waive the rights or duties of the employer under common policy and practice , nor under the FLMA of 1993 . There are indemnification type health insurance policies that may provide some cash benefit , and you can buy disability insurance prior to the pregancy that can cover medical as a disability , but they wo n't impact the employer benefits nor their right to expect you to return to work when their maternity leave expires .

The whole life policy will have an initial premium that is greater than the term insurance premium , because it is going to pay the death benefit sometime and it guarantees not to increase the premium , ever . The whole life policy can do this because it accumulates reserves in anticipation of the increasing frequency of death claims as you age . These accumulated reserves become the cash value of the policy . Because the premium for term insurance increases as you become older there will be as point at which the whole life insurance purchased at an earlier age will be cheaper than the term policy purchased at an increased age .

As an answer I 'd say that I think every child at some point say 's to their parent , `` I do n't want to , and you ca n't make me ! '' . The end result is that while no one can make you do anything as a child , or as an adult , they can make it increasingly painful for you until you do as they asked . That is the case with health insurance . The Government ca n't make you buy it , but they can and will start penalizing you in increasing amounts until you do . There is a good reason for buying it , and another is this : Doctors are required to treat everyone , insurance or not . As a result , everyone that does not have insurance gets some form of treatment , and the rest of us get the bill , in the form of higher prices we pay when we need help . By having some of these people take responsibility for their own costs , in theory , it lowers costs for the rest of us .

All of these plans , by law , must be guaranteed to be issued by the insurance carrier , can not be subject to underwriting and must cover pre-existing conditions immediately with no lifetime limits on coverage . In addition , all plans must cover what are referred to as the Minimum Essential Benefits . These requirements range from covering a wide range of preventive care services at 100 % , coverage for maternity , mental health & substance abuse along with a variety of other services including pediatric dental & vision to even educating women on how to nurse their babies -LRB- how the human race survived for thousands of yearswithout the government providing for such training is a mystery to me -RRB- .

If the repair cost meets or exceeds 70 % of that figure , as a practical guideline , the car would probably be totalled . "}
{"input": "When Will Car Insurance Total A Car?

If the same vehicle suffers damages of $ 4,500.00 the vehicle will be repaired . However if the damages get to close to the value of the vehicle the insurance company may elect to total the vehicle as there may be ongoing issues that can cost the insurance company more money . The insurance company will chose the option that costs the insurance company the least amount of money . Of course safety to the consumer is always an important consideration as well . I have seen vehicles with very low market values become totaled for a minor fender bender and I have seen expensive vehicles suffer major damage and still end up being repaired . If the damages can be fixed properly for a lower cost then totaling the vehicle , then this option is almost always the first option . Insureds will have very little say so in choosing to total their own vehicle as how damages are handled are written in the contract . "}

Does life insurance fit the current version of the definition of the word investment ? I say current version because what is and what is n't an investment has changed over the years . Now days investment as a definition carries far more RISK in it than can be found in a traditional cash value life policy . Should life insurance be a part of a person 's investment portfolio ? In most cases yes as life insurance can be part of a financial plan that fits a person 's risk tolerances . But life insurance should n't be primarily sold as an investment .

{"input": "How To Save For Your Retirement At 30? ", "output": "The fact that this is your question is significant . I often ask people to take their picture and go to the internet where they can have the picture morphed to age 65 . When they have the picture , ask the picture what they should do for retirement . You are never too young to begin saving for retirement and if you are thirty there is an awfully good chance that you will spend almost half of your life retired . If you are working for a company that offers a retirement program , that is the first place to look . What you are looking for is the maximum amount that your employer will match of your contributions and what you must do to get those matching funds . This is free money and is best regardless of other difficulties you might see with the plan . At the same time check the vesting schedule to see if you will be able to actually receive those benefits depending upon how long you reasonably expect to work for the company . Since your company controls all the investments that your retirement plan might have , you might want to think twice before contributing more than the minimum required to get the maximum matching funds . It is worth noting that the company sponsored plan is probably covered under ERISA and that gives you some guarantees you can not get elsewhere . The whole financial world is out looking for additional contributions that you might want to make to your retirement . My first advice is to get a planner with whom you are comfortable . Some planners dont listen well and you really want one that will listen to your dreams and aspirations . The planner you want will communicate clearly with you and with any companies that help manage your money . It will be his job to match your dreams to your abilities to provide for those dreams . If your planner constantly boasts about his advice and returns on investment , look for the exit . High returns on investments often go hand in hand with disastrous results . The fundamental thing to remember about retirement planning is that return on investment is not the key issue . The key issue is shifting consumption . When you move capital to your future you accomplish your mission . Fundamentally , saving for retirement is consuming less now so you can consume more lately . The return on investment is frosting on the cake . Many who leaned on return on investment found themselves unable to retire in 2008 . That was recently . Without stepping into your planners shoes , I would like to point out that you are probably in a lower income tax bracket now than you will be in the future . This makes it important to consider a Roth IRA as your funding vehicle . While not giving you a current tax break it does provide a retirement benefit that can not be obtained elsewheretax free income . There are other significant benefits but being able to drawn down a tax free account is a wonderful option . "}

A `` preferred '' rate class would reduce those numbers by about 15-20 % . Discounts can reduce premium significantly , if applicable.Long-term care insurance policies used to cost a lot less . But , to be truthful , insurance companies really miscalculated how much it would cost to pay out the high claims of an average policyowner and how much premium it would take to stay in business and make a profit . Even today , with higher premiums for the same coverage design available 10 years ago , the margins on this type of insurance are very thin . Recent claims history studies have shown that 1 -RRB- policyowners do not allow these policies to lapse - less than 1 % do , 2 -RRB- more policyowners than anticipated are going on claim , and 3 -RRB- the cost of medical facilities and skilled home care is going up at a greater rate than most consumer price indices -LRB- CPI -RRB- .

If one ca n't afford the insurance , it is imperative to have a family discussion about a plan for family caregiving that might be needed before one dies . -RRB- There are lots of ways to keep costs for long-term care insurance affordable . Design is everything .

Finally , buy young . Some LTCi experts suggest buying as young as 40 . Most recommend that one not wait past 60 because premiums really start to climb after that age . By age 50 , you should be seriously considering it . -LRB- I bought mine at age 53 and bought it on my wife when she was 49 , and while it has been difficult in lean years to pay the premiums , I am so glad that we have kept the coverage in force .

{"input": "What's Similar Between 401K And Roth IRA? ", "output": "The similarity between a Roth IRA and a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan is that they are both qualified retirement plans . The Internal Revenue Service has issued regulations on both and they appear in the Code . The number 401 -LRB- k -RRB- is the code section that permits that specific type of retirement program . In both programs the income tax on earnings from money held in the program is tax-deferred , meaning that there isnt any income tax on the earnings in the current year . A Roth IRA is an individual plan . You own the plan . The money that you put into the plan is made with money that has already been taxed . You dont need to be the employee of a particular company to have a Roth IRA . There isnt any tax current tax deduction for the deposit . You can have a Roth IRA even if you have a retirement plan elsewhere . As a plan owner you select where the funds are to be invested , within limits . There are adjusted gross income limits to participation so check with your advisor if you have relatively high income . A non-working spouse can have a Roth IRA . A 401 -LRB- k -RRB- is an employer sponsored plan . Your employer sets up the plan and either administers the plan directly or uses a third party administrator to maintain the plan . Under most circumstances the employer states clearly who can participate in the plan . The money contributed to the plan is normally deducted from your paycheck before income tax is withheld . That is because that money is tax-deferred . There wont be any current income tax on that money . Sometimes employers will match some of the money contributed as an incentive . Particularly when the employer contributes to the plan there will probably be a vesting schedule . That means that the money contributed by the employer isnt really yours until you meet a certain criteria for service or participation in the plan . The plan will also stipulate whether in-service withdrawals can be made , and the conditions under which they can be made . During the accumulation phase withdrawals from a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan can trigger a taxable event . However , with a Roth IRA if the program has been in place for more than five years and you are older than 59.5 , or have become disabled or need the money for a first-time home purchase , there isnt a penalty tax of 10 % . You can also use the money for higher education costs . Withdrawals for education prior to your reaching age 59.5 will be subject to income tax even though they are not subject to the additional 10 % penalty tax . You can withdraw up to the total of your payments without income tax or the additional 10 % penalty tax . Treatment can be different under a 401 -LRB- k. -RRB- The plan itself might not allow in-service withdrawals and income tax and penalty could also be charged . During the accumulation phase the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan will offer a limited number of investment options , often including an option to purchase company stock . Those are the only investment options available . However , a Roth IRA can be funded with a variety of investments and changed whenever it is deemed best by you . When you retire with a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- the IRS will require that starting after you reach 70.5 you must make withdrawals every year . These are scheduled in the code . With a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- these withdrawals are treated as ordinary income and are fully taxed . This is not a requirement of your Roth IRA . Withdrawals are not required and when you decide to take them , they are free of income tax if you are over 59.5 years old . You can name a beneficiary with both types of plans ; however with the Roth IRA if the plan has been held for more than five years , the funds can pass to an heir tax-free . The key issue is that deposits in a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- are currently not included in your income tax and may be matched by your employer . The contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars . When you retire all of the money in your 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan will be taxed as withdrawn as ordinary income , however , none of the money from a Roth IRA will be taxed . "}

{"input": "What Are The Two Different Types Of Life Insurance? ", "output": "Term and permanent life insurance are the two basic types . Term life insurance is for temporary needs where the coverage duration is known and finite . Most term policies are available for periods of up to 30 years and may feature level annual premiums . There is no cash surrender value in most products -LRB- except for return of premium term -RRB- . At older ages , term rapidly becomes cost prohibitive and is generally not available for long durations . Term is a relatively simple product to understand and so affordable , it can fit most any budget . It is ideal in situations such as with young families who have a tight budget and need life insurance for protection for up to 30 years . For business situations , it is frequently used to fund buy-sell agreements to ensure the cash will be available for share purchases in the event of untimely death . For coverage that does not expire before you do , permanent -LRB- cash value -RRB- life insurance is more appropriate . Most term policies feature conversion without evidence of insurability to permanent policies later when they can better afford the premium for lifetime funding and coverage . Permanent life insurance variations - whole life , universal life , etc. - and are designed to provide lifetime death benefit protection that can not be outlived . Cash values build over time which help make the premium you pay level over the life of the policy . "}

A whole life policy is better if you want long term coverage , and want the option of having cash available should you need it . If you would like to find out which one might be a better fit , please contact me , and I 'll help you figure it out . Thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "Term Or Whole Life Insurance Which Is Best? ", "output": "Neither is ` best ' in terms of comparing one against the other . What you need to look at is what you are going to count on this insurance plan for and why you need it . Term insurance is better for covering large amounts for shorter periods of time , such as putting a policy in place to ensure your children -LRB- or grandchildren -RRB- will have money for college should something happen to you prior to them completing college . Or you could set up a policy that would pay off your mortgage and/or other debts so you do n't leave those behind in the event something happens prior to them being paid off . Whole Life insurance is better for establishing long term wealth accumulation . Here 's an example of the way I set up one of my customers . Since it is possible to have multiple policies , we set up a 10 year term policy listingtheir children as beneficiaries to guarantee they have money for college . We also calculated how much income they would potentially earn during that 10 year period and included that amount so their spouse was n't left without income . Then we set upa 20 year term policy equal to the amount of theirhome mortgage so that would be paid off and calculated who much income they would earn during this next 10 year period.Finally , we establisheda whole life policy witha small face valueto help establishan estate for theirheirs . Since the whole life policy pays out the face value or the cash value , whichever is higher , the ` death benefit ' of the whole life policy increased as time went on . We also established that when the 10 year policy expired , if their income level permitted , they would continue making those monthly payments , but they would add that to the Whole Life policy . Doing this dramatically increased the cash accumulation of that policy after the 10 year mark . So my recommendation for you is to meet with a qualified insurance agent or financial planner to establish the right scenario for you and your family . "}
{"input": "Term Or Whole Life Insurance Which Is Best?

Depending upon age and health , term coverage can be a very low cost way of protecting against a premature death .

Its not an easy number to come up with but there are free tools available on the Internet to assist you with this effort -LRB- Google-Residential Replacement Cost Calculators -RRB- . Insurance companies normally do their own replacement cost estimates and will suggest or require certain minimum limits for specific types of coverage . Your lender , if you have one , may also have coverage requirements so your ultimate decision will be a combination of these factors . Just remember , you are the one buying the coverage and paying the premium . Make sure your needs and expectations are considered . The actual cost to rebuild your home will vary depending on local conditions following your loss . Hurricanes , tornadoes , wild fires and the like cause devastation to entire areas . Contractors , labor and materials may not be available at normal costs . Many insurance companies offer policies , which base the amount of insurance on normal building costs , but automatically increase the limit to whatever you need to rebuild your home should costs change dramatically following your claim . This feature is commonly referred to as Guaranteed Dwelling Replacement Cost , make sure to consider this feature if it is available . Separate additional amounts of insurance will be included for your personal property , other non-business structures on your property and additional living expense . These limits are functions of the amount you carry on your home , normally they are more than adequate but make sure you are comfortable with them as they can be increased if necessary . The other major part of the policy will be your personal liability limit . That limit should be consistent with the liability limits you carry on your auto -LRB- s -RRB- and not less than $ 300,000 .

While you can try to come up with an `` average '' cost , there 's too many factors that go into premium pricing to say how in relation that compares to an individual as compared to the overall group .

{"input": "Can You Combine Annuities? ", "output": "While the answer is - `` YES '' , you can combine annuities - it is important to bear in mind that some annuities have different tax treatment than others . My advice is to only combine annuity money of a similar nature with that of another . For example , an IRA -LRB- individual Retirement Account -RRB- provides a deduction on the IRS 1040 against income . Because of this feature and tax benefit , all money coming out of an IRA , both interest and basis , are taxed as income upon distribution . In other words , because of the tax deduction , distributions from an IRA are taxed as if all the money coming from the account is being taxed for the first time . An ordinary tax qualified annuity , a non-IRA annuity , incurs taxation only on the gain at the time of distribution . This exclusion formula recognizes that some of the money deposited was already taxed as ordinary income when you first earned it and this money will not be taxed again at distribution . That is why I suggest honoring the character of the money and keeping IRA 's with IRA 's , etc. . This simple rule of thumb will help relieve you of explaining years later the source or the money and help you argue successfully that some money should not be taxed . Who among us will remember 30-40 years hence how these accounts were merged ? There are a whole other set of rules for conversions and methods to avoid taxation prior to annuitization and the beginning of the payout period of your annuities . This answer covers general theory only on the idea you want to minimize taxation to the largest extent possible . "}

{"input": "Is Universal Health Insurance A Good Idea? ", "output": "Medical care has a price . In the open market it is fixed by consumers who want a service and medical personnel who can deliver the service . The problem occurs when someone needs the treatment but can not or will not pay the price for the service . I say , Will not because every decision about spending is discretionary . Should society as a whole bear the responsibility for the medical care for every resident ? Should the nature of that care be regulated ? Should the source of funding be general ? Those are the most pressing questions when considering a universal health care system . Ultimately in a universal health care system there is a specified list of services and a funding mechanism that is not based upon need for medical services . You may need a procedure that isnt covered in the program . At the same time you might consider another procedure immoral or frivolous . Who is going to decide ? The idea of universal health care sounds very good until you understand that some medical services will probably not be covered . In the USSR dental hygiene consisted of inserting a fluorescent tube into the patients mouth and surgery was routinely conducted in a super-cold environment because anesthesia was not readily available . In that case , most Americans would consider the health care to be inadequate . However , it was available to all and at little or no direct cost to the consumer . Under most regimes universal health care becomes rationed health care . The best example is the army under war time conditions . It is called triage but it means that you treat those with the greatest likelihood of recovery before treating soldiers with graver injuries . While it might be the best utilization of manpower , the soldier with his leg blown off , might not like the wait and a narcotic shot is not going to make his family happy . The issue of who is going to pay for the universal health care system is the most sensitive . No one wants to see others in need . By the same token no one wants to pay the high bill for medical treatment . If the universal care is funded by general funds from taxes it will always be a political football . If it is paid by premiums paid by individuals there will always be a need to assist those unable to pay the premium . The problem really boils down to our expectations of treatment level , the availability and cost of that treatment and who is going to pay the price . Yes , it sounds like a great idea but it has many difficulties and when it is expected then the society will start to question the need for universal flat screen TVs , micro-wave ovens and wall-to-wall carpets . There really isnt an end unless you look at the Soviet Union and see how it ended . "}
{"input": "Is Universal Health Insurance A Good Idea? ", "output": "Is universal health insurance a good idea ? Well yes and no . In some countries it works very well , others not so much . Some of this could be that usually in countries that are universal health countries some access to health care services are limited , some drugs are n't available because of profit margin limits . I think the happiness depends on the culture of the population . The hard thing I see for America adopting Universal Healthcare would be the idea of limited or delayed services as we as a culture , only wait for cell phones and movie premieres . Certainly there is more to it , but that is for another day as the answer is n't easy and would take pages of text to cover . "}
{"input": "Is Universal Health Insurance A Good Idea? ", "output": "This debate has been going on for the last century . In theory , how could anyone be opposed to everyone having health insurance ? And , in theory , if everyone was in the insurance risk pool this would be the best way to spread health care costs equally . By the same token , how could anyone be opposed to everyone having good and ample food & water , and everyone needs housing , and everyone needs utilities for their housing , and everyone needs transportation and there is a long list of other needs that we all have . The real question is can a society afford universal health insurance and thus universal health care in the sense that most Americans have become accustomed to getting it ? When you start looking at the economics of health care this becomes much more problematic . Health care is different from most services we consume in that it creates its own growing demand . Who does n't want to live longer , and live healthier during that longer life ? And , as you have probably noticed , we have a continually growing list of parts we can replace , once deadly illnesses we can now manage or cure , and treatments that just improve your `` quality of life '' . All this comes with a price tag and the price just keeps going up . I was born in 1957 for a cost of $ 400 , my son was born in 1987 for a cost of $ 4000 , and today a normal childbirth is easily $ 8000 + . As best as I can tell , babies are born the same way today as they were in 1957 but the cost has far outpaced general inflation levels in the economy as a whole over that time period . The painful reality is that providing universal healthcare in a modern society -LRB- e , g , - North America , Europe -RRB- has not been accomplished without rationing of healthcare services -LRB- however it might be disguised -RRB- . For instance , we have more MRI scanners in Memphis , TN than in all of Canada -LRB- a nation often cited as an example of where universal health insurance is a success -RRB- . Tests that get ordered and conducted on the same day here can have waiting times of months up there . There really is no definitive answer to your question .

This is what I have learned , to help speed up the process . 1 -RRB- Put all the doctors you have seen in the past 5 years on your application , and include the doctor who diagnosed your most serious health conditions . Delays often happen because records are received , but then the underwriter notices that the patient was referred to someone else during that time . Getting all your doctors noted at the start does not necessarily mean the insurance company will order records from all of them , but at least it gives underwriters the opportunity to pick and choose which ones they want , so they order them in a timely manner . 2 -RRB- Do your exam quickly . Putting of an exam for months sets back the whole application process . Sometimes medical records are not even ordered until the exam is done . 3 -RRB- Warn your doctor or clinic that they will be getting a request for your medical records , and ask them to fill the order ASAP . You might even want to collect your own medical records to speed things up , if that is allowed . 4 -RRB- Provide additional details in a timely manner . Sometimes insurance companies will see something on your MIB or MVR or application that will cause them to need more information . Answering that extra question , filling out that extra form , or doing whatever needs to be done , can eliminate unnecessary delays . 5 -RRB- Do n't jump to another company without talking it over with your agent first . Give him/her a chance to find out where the logjam is , and get it cleared up . If you can not get answers from your agent , it 's OK to switch , but close your first application out , or transfer it to someone else . Otherwise , you may end up applying for the same policy with two different agents , and that can cause further complications and delays . "}

If the mold is growing because your house is old and moisture got in due to lack of maintenance , then you are out of luck . Another example is water backup , if your sewage drain backs up and you have resultant damage , without a sewer/drain backup endorsement you will be denied coverage .

A common question we see from persons with their auto insurance , home insurance , etc. from a propertly and casualty insurance company who are looking for life insurance is `` do I get any discounts for having my life insurance through them as well ? '' - the answer is NO . Carriers can not discount their life insurance rates under the guise of a multi-policy discount like they may with auto insurance and home insurance . Life insurance is a different marketplace from property and casualty insurance . If you 're looking for life insurance coverage , you should consult with an experienced independent life insurance broker who can shop the case for you among a large number of places to determine which carrier will be able to offer you the lowest rates for the desired coverage . Please note , the most important factor when looking for life insurance is the RISK CLASSIFICATION that you qualify for - the risk classification determines the premiums for the program . Without knowing the details of your medical history , any quotes any agent provides are pretty much just guestimates and are for the most part , meaningless . Each carrier has different underwriting so you may be looking at preferred with one carrier , and standard with another - the result being one carrier offering the coverage at a lower price than others . At the same time , you do n't want to apply to multiple companies at the same time as this works against you - it 's basically a sort of red flag to insurance companies . You want to try to get it right the first time which is where a broker comes in handy because they can shop it for you with the medical history and get you in the right direction - brokers also do n't charge fees for their services so it can only help you .

Focus on that death benefit or face amount . Do n't be distracted by cash values , living benefits , etc. to begin with . -LRB- That can come later -RRB- . As far as choosing a `` good life insurance policy '' , the answers are endless . But , here are a few basic parameters to guide you to the answer that is best for you :1 . Ask the beneficiary , `` What would you do if I -LRB- the proposed-insured -RRB- were to die today ? '' . `` Do '' is the key word . This is not a quantitative inquiry . It has to do with values . What matters most to the person you care about ? 2 . Then , `` what would be the negative financial impact to the beneficiary if I were to die today ? '' This is n't that hard for most people . It has to do directly with what the beneficiary believes they would do if the insured dies . For instance , if the beneficiary would sell the house , do n't put that into the equation . If there 's debt , do put it in the equation . Income replacement is typically the most important . But , it may not be if there are no children and the beneficiary has a career . See ? It all depends on what the beneficiary would do . 3 . Once the amount is determined , my suggestion is to first buy a permanent plan of insurance that would cover final expenses . That does n't have to be a large face amount . But , it should be big enough to take care if immediate funeral and burial costs projected to mortality age .4 . Cover the rest of the need with low-cost , guaranteed level premium and fully convertible -LRB- exchange all or part of the term to a permanent plan of insurance without the need to medically qualify -RRB- term.Now you can discuss bells and whistles .

{"input": "How Can I Cancel My Health Insurance In Tennessee? ", "output": "Individual and group health insurance policies can be terminated essentially at any time by the policyholder . The correct manner is to send in a written notice of termination to your health insurance carrier that states the date of termination . Generally the date of termination should be for a date after you are sending in the termination notice . For example , you send in a letter on June 5th notifying the insurance carrier of your intent to terminate coverage effective July 1st . Attempting to terminate your coverage in a retroactive manner is more problematic and should be avoided if at all possible . First of all , if premiums have already been paid for the period you are wanting to backdate your coverage to the insurance carrier will be within their rights to hold on to your premium and to check if any claims activity has occurred during that period . Even in this electronic age a claim may not be filed immediately after services are rendered and the insurance carrier has to be mindful of this lag time . For this reason a request for a retroactive termination will certainly be delayed and if any claims activity came in during that period the request for a retroactive termination would most likely be denied and granted for the fist of the next month . Then there is the less graceful way of cancelling your coverage and that is simply not to make your premium payment . Failure to pay is a violation of your individual or group contract terms and will lead to contract cancellation by the insurance carrier . I do not recommend this approach as it is bad personal and/or business practice . Also , most individual health insurance contracts and an increasing number of group health plans are set up on an automatic bank draft basis . Failure to provide a notice of termination will not stop this automatic draft from being drawn from your account . Sometimes people put a `` stop pay '' order for the draft on their bank account , for which you have to pay the bank a fee , and then from the insurance carrier 's perspective when they attempt to make the monthly payment draft this is no different than getting a bounced check so they will still attempt to collect payment while adding a late payment charge onto the premium . This situation can get quite messy and end up taking more of your time to resolve than simply sending in a termination notice . "}

So , the term `` single-premium immediate annuity '' is a bit redundant . Think of it as taking retirement money from a privately funded pension , except that , in this case , you are funding it with a one-time , lump-sum of money.The important thing to remember is that once you pay the single premium , that money is essentially `` gone '' . You have just `` purchased '' an income that you can not outlive.There are all sorts of ways to design the annuity -LRB- stream of income -RRB- . You can get a monthly check , quarterly check , annual check - just about any payment schedule you can think of . You can also have the annuity pay out completely should you die before the original single premium you gave to the insurance company gets paid out . Should you choose that option , you will need to name a `` beneficiary '' to receive the remainder of the payout.Annuities , in general , are complex insurance contracts and space is not provided here to go into all the details . But , be absolutely certain that an annuity is right for you before you fork over the money because once it is committed to the contract , you either ca n't get a refund or there are stiff surrender penalties associated with backing out of the deal .

{"input": "How Much Term Life Insurance Should You Have? ", "output": "There 's no exact figure on how much coverage someone should have and we all have our own needs and cost tolerance . A good way to figure out how much coverage you should have is by totalling up the debts and other expenses you want to have paid off in the event you passed away suddenly -LRB- e.g. mortgage , cars , kids college expenses , credit cards , other loans , etc. -RRB- . Then determine the amount of income needed for your spouse and kids if you died - this is generally around 70 % of current income amount - and multiply that by the number of years you want to make sure they 're taken care of at that level -LRB- e.g. 5 years , 7 years , 10 years , etc. -RRB- . If you have investment income or other sources of savings , the total amount of coverage needed may vary . This is a good starting point and should help you create an approximated figure of how much coverage you should have in place . The number of years of coverage depends on the need -LRB- some may be 15 years , some 20 , some 30 , etc. -RRB- . You should consult with an independent life insurance broker who can work with you on a personal level to determine how much coverage you should have to meet your goals and create a suitable structure for your budget . In many cases , you will likely need a larger amount of coverage for the next few years and less coverage down the line .

{"input": "What Is A Paid Up Life Insurance Policy? ", "output": "A paid up life insurance policy is exactly what it sounds like - it is a policy that is all paid for . Therefore , no more premiums are due while the policy remains in force and the death benefit will be paid upon the death of the insured . These usually are an option when someone stops paying on a whole life policy before age 100 . The premiums that the insured has paid up to that point are used to purchase a `` paid in full '' policy , of course with a lower death benefit than the original policy was offering .

{"input": "How Long Should I Have Life Insurance? ", "output": "How long you should have life insurance depends on the purpose you want your coverage to serve . If you want life insurance to pay for you funeral or memorial service expenses , then you really need to have a permanent policy . How awful it would be to pay into life insurance to age 80 and then have the policy end . If you have life insurance to pay for expenses that will cease to exist after a period of years , then you can get life insurance coverage that lasts that number of years . A great example of this is 30 year Term Life Insurance to cover a 30 year mortgage . If you want life insurance to provide income during retirement , you could buy Indexed Universal Life that you pay into until retirement age , then draw on without paying any more premiums the rest of your life . Many people purchase different lengths of policies to accomplish different needs . If that is too much for your budget , just buy what you can afford . Something is always better than nothing . "}

{"input": "Who Does The Spendthrift Clause In A Life Insurance Policy Protect?

Some policies allow the policy owner to select this settlement option for the beneficiary . Otherwise , the beneficiary selects this . The payout could be arranged as a fixed payment for as long as the money lasts or for a fixed period of time . The proceeds are then usually protected from creditors . Creditor protection via life insurance varies by state and may provide only limited protection . Contact your legal adviser for more on how this might apply in your situation . "}

Most Annuities that are considered `` cd type '' Annuities , have a guaranteed rate during the surrender period . Then it switches to the current rate once there are no more surrender charges . But at this time , if the owner does not like the current rate , they are free to switch to a different product with no surrender charges/fees . "}
{"input": "Is Whole Life Insurance A Tax Shelter? ", "output": "That is an excellent question ! There are definitely ways that your life insurance can be used as a hedge against taxes . You will pay a lot more up front , but with careful planning , you can reap some sizable tax advantages . For example : With careful planning , the value of the death benefit can be excluded from estate taxes ; by paying larger premiums into a policy like a UL , or indexed UL , you can create a very large cash value that can be withdrawn tax free as an income until it is used up ; and in cash value policies , even if you withdraw more than the premiums you 've paid in , the amount is considered a loan , and again is tax free . There are dangers in doing these things , so you want to consult a good agent or tax advisor first , okay ? please contact me if you need help , and thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "Is Whole Life Insurance A Tax Shelter? ", "output": "Tax shelter implies that once that value is removed from the shelter it could trigger is a taxable event . That is is case with a whole life while you are living , however , the total death benefit of a whole life policy is tax free . Remember , the primary purpose of life insurance is to provide tax free cash at death . Whole life does offer tax advantaged growth . In Canada , for example a whole life policy 's cash value is exempt from accrual taxation within certain limits . Considering the tax free growth of the cash value , whole life or Universal Life for that matter , might be considered tax shelters , but it they are better thought of as having tax advantaged grow .

{"input": "How Do I Handle A Retirement Shortfall? ", "output": "You are not unique . Studies show that less than twenty percent of those without an active plan for retirement feel confident about retiring . Here are four strategies that you can pursue if you are unsure that you can retire on the income you will receive when you retire . The first strategy is to increase your savings for retirement now . As people approach retirement they frequently lose responsibility for children , their mortgage may become paid-off and their disposable income might climb . Seizing this opportunity to increase saving for retirement is crucial . If your employer matches what you put into a retirement or savings program try to make a matching contribution to the company plan . Be careful about putting excessive money into the company plan as the investments contained in the portfolio might now reflect your risk tolerance and you could become quite worried over them . Maximum contributions increase on certain retirement savings programs and you should explore the opportunity that could afford to you . Make sure your retirements savings are coordinated . A retirement income expert could be very helpful in this regard . There are severe penalties if you inadvertently overfund a pension or retirement savings plan . If you are saving all you legally can for retirement you should then focus on reducing debt . The less debt that you carry into retirement the higher your satisfaction will be . At a minimum eliminate any credit card debt and installment purchase debt . Discuss with your accountant the wisdom of reducing or eliminating a mortgage . The second strategy would be to get better performance from your investments . This can be a reason to sit down with someone who specializes in retirement portfolios . You could have investments that have underperformed for a while and have little prospects of rebounding . This might be the time to adjust your assets so that you are better able to reach your retirement goals . The third strategy is often overlooked and yet it is the most obvious . You might be able to work longer . Forty percent of retirees start retirement because of some unforeseen event and at a date that they had not selected . The illness of parents , spouse or children can often force an early retirement . As you approach retirement make an inventory of your marketable skills and interests . Focus your attention on what you want to do and develop the expertise to move into that area whenever retirement starts . If this means staying at your current employer that can be negotiated most of the time . Some people negotiate for reduced hours , or returning to the exact same job as a consultant . If you like your work and you like those you work with , dont think that you must quit because you have reached some arbitrary age . Working longer is the quickest way to enhance your retirement income . My brother could probably work into his 90s because he was a programmer over fifty years and knows some proprietary computer languages that are still being used , but few people can program them . The fourth strategy is to decide to live on less . If this is going to be your strategy , start reducing your standard of living now . Waiting until the day you retire to downsize can bring more trauma than you want . You can live on less now , save the difference . Then when you retire you can keep marching along . This can include moving to a smaller , less difficult to manage single story home . This could mean resuming cooking rather than eating in restaurants . It usually will include reducing the number of cars . For some this will mean establishing a joint residence with a child . While this can be done , planning is essential . Your childs idea might be putting you in the middle bedroom and that might not be desirable . These are practical strategies that anyone can follow to increase the likelihood that your assets will not be exhausted in your retirement and that you can enjoy your retirement . Planning is really the key to having a successful retirement . "}
{"input": "How Do I Handle A Retirement Shortfall? ", "output": "Boy is that the million dollar question of the day ! There are a whole lot of folks asking that same question ... Without knowing your financial status or how near/far into retirement that you are , I can not give you a specific plan of attack , but there are some things that you can start doing immediately that will help . The first is downsize . Move to a smaller house , or less expensive area . Sell off the extra car , unneeded belongings , anything that is no longer really close to your heart , and can generate some cash . Do the same thing with your debt . Tighten the belt and pay off every high interest credit card or loan that you have . Save that interest you 'd be paying for food and electricity . Take the money that you 've found , and invest it in an investment vehicle that will provide you with an income . The second is prioritize . What are you doing that you really could be doing without ? Are you eating out 12 times a week ? Is that more important than saving for your retirement ? Things like lottery tickets , entertainment , take a second and ask yourself if they 're worth the cost . I certainly am not telling you to stop enjoying life , but I 'd ask you to consider if there is a cheaper way to do so -LRB- And lottery tickets I will tell you to stop . You lose far more money than you will ever win -RRB- . The third is to re-evaluate your current savings plan . Can you re-allocate your investments ? Do you have any annuitized investments that you can be assured to not outlive ? Can you shuffle investments that may have under-performed into better ones ? Lastly , are there ways to increase your income ? Can one of you put off taking SSI benefits , -LRB- The longer that you delay the start of the payments , the larger those lifetime payments will be -RRB- , work longer , or use a hobby to generate an income ? If you like gardening , for example , can you grow vegetables to sell , or flowers to arrange for sale ? Using something that you love to do anyway as a secondary source of income is as emotionally rewarding as it is financially rewarding . I hope that there was something in my answer that will help you , have faith . Matthew tells us that God provides for our daily needs , and if you can honestly say that He has done so so far , it 's a safe bet He will continue to . Thanks for asking ! "}
{"input": "Who Should I Buy Life Insurance From? ", "output": "I have given a lot of thought to this question . As you know , I sell life insurance professionally . It is a very competitive marketplace , and consumers have many options . You can go to independent brokers . You can go to captive agents . You can go to P&C brokers , group benefits consultants , financial planners . You can go to bankers , accountants , stockbrokers , and virtually every other financial professional who cross-sells . You can go on-line . You can go to some companies directly . I have staked my ground as a self-employed , independent , life insurance specialist . I think this model equips me to give not just good service , but outstanding service to my clients . I will tell you why . You can not be a jack of all trades and master of none . Life insurance is not an add - on commodity . It happens to be the most complex and extensively underwritten financial product in the marketplace . In some cases , you can go through more hoops buying life insurance than if you were buying a business . A life insurance broker needs to be a master of the underwriting process . He has to guide people through those hoops to get the most desirable results . Therefore he has to specialize in this product , and this product only . Financial representatives who have become expert in another niche simply can not master a second one . How many master builders out there are also master electricians and master plumbers ? The broker also has to be independent . Its not just a question of having access to multiple companies because different companies will be competitive for different insurance . Its also a question of having access to different distributors . Different general agents will have leverage with different underwriters in different companies . You cant just affiliate with one wholesaler and expect them to get the job done right for everyone of your clients . You need to spread your business around . Treating your sales practice like a business is also key . You are not just a salesman , and you are not just an expert . You are a businessman who can not survive without clients . You do not get paid until they are happy with the policy they bought . You need to have an attitude of keeping the customer satisfied . And that starts with making integrity the core of your business model . Every quote given should be both competitive and reliable . People should know what theyre getting before they sign on the dotted line . They should expect to get approved at the rate quoted . This is a normal expectation every consumer has . Whether you aree buying a toaster , a car , or an entire corporation , the product must be delivered at the agreed-upon price . This means that the life insurance salesman must make a commitment and an investment in every client taken on . He will have to negotiate and advocate on behalf of the client to make sure that all parties involved in the prequalification and underwriting processes perform with integrity . This way you as the consumer will be a happy camper when you do business with that broker . And that is the bottom line . "}

{"input": "What Is The Role Of The Investment Advisor In A Mutual Fund? ", "output": "That is a great question ! The role of the adviser is supposed to be as a guide to helping you select the best funds for your desired goals in your portfolio .

They are supposed to be experts in identifying well performing funds , trends , and emerging investments . Many of them are very good , and have clients that are well prepared for retirement . There are many of them that are paid by their brokerage house for the specific funds they want sold , and for the commissions and profits earned for the brokerage . Their focus may not then be so much on your needs as it is theirs , and that 's been the industry rub . The high fees hidden in the fund structure has led to an increasing number of investors switching to indexed funds -LRB- like Vanguard -RRB- or moving away from the brokerage houses and purchasing their leading stock investments themselves , and eliminating the fees and middlemen . Nobody likes to see that the person who is supposed to be making you money is making more off you than you are making . If you choose to invest in a mutual fund that has an adviser , please be sure to meet with them face to face . Interview them before investing . Ask about how they are paid , what the fees are for the fund , and real life performance on the fund , not projections . Ask how often the stocks within the portfolio are exchanged -LRB- anything close to 100 % is risky for you - they make money for the brokerage on the exchanges , increasing fundholders ' expense -RRB- .

{"input": "What Is The Best Life Insurance Term Or Whole? ", "output": "They are both the best . It 's kind of like asking which tire on your bicycle is best , unless you 're really good at doing wheelies you 'll need both to get where you want to go . To keep things simple , someday you are going to die . At a minimum there will be funeral expenses to pay , perhaps some unpaid bills and maybe you want to leave something behind for your loved ones . The hard part is our birth certificates do n't come with an expiration date on them so we never know exactly when the Grim Reaper is going to arrive . A wise person would have a paid up whole life insurance policy with a coverage amount that can address these basic issues . However , whole life insurance is more expensive than it 's cousin , term life insurance , and many people ca n't afford to cover all of their potential death exposure over the course of their entire lives with whole life insurance alone . At certain stages of our lives , generally our most productive years when people are starting their careers , marrying and having families , carrying home mortgages and car loans , needing to put the kids through college , etc. , if the person were to pass away during these stages of their life they need a much larger amount of life insurance to provide for all of the unmet needs they would leave behind . This is where term life insurance comes into the picture . You can buy a much larger amount of death benefit for a lower cost for a period of 10 , 20 or 30 years with term life insurance thus protecting your loved ones during the period when your loss would be most financially devastating . So , really , you need to have both types of life insurance and just get good advice as to what the appropriate amounts of each type of policy should be to maximize your protection over the expected course of your entire life .

If you are applying for a medically underwritten policy , you will then need to take a free insurance exam in your home or place of your choice . 5 -RRB- Wait for approval . Hopefully , you will be working with an agency that lets you know if you can help in other ways -LRB- e.g. call your doctor 's office to ask them to provide your medical records more quickly , clarify something on your application , etc -RRB- . That extra bit of customer service can be the difference between approval and decline . 6 -RRB- Pay for your policy and treasure it for years to come . "}
{"input": "How To By Life Insurance? ", "output": "Im going to answer your question this way : Im going to describe for you the kind of person who buys life insurance and is really glad they did . They are happy with the policy they bought ; they are happy with the process they went through to get that policy ; and they are happy to tell all their friends and neighbors about how happy they are with the purchase :-RRB- . These are the qualities of a happy life insurance shopper : Quality number one : the happy life insurance shopper dares to care . Look , life insurance is not for you , right ? Its for your beneficiaries . And frankly , some people could care less about what happens after they die . I mean , to put it bluntly , they are dead , right ? Isnt that what it comes down to ? But for other people , the difference between being alive and being dead is not that great . I mean , you have spent a lifetime building something of value . Your marriage . Your family . Your business . Charitable causes worthy of your support . All these folks have become dependent on you . If you die , they could lose their economic foundation . But if you have insurance on your life , then they dont have to miss a dime . Life can go on in style for your spouse , your children , your business partners , your employees , and all the needy people that are being helped by the charities you support . If you care about these people , then life insurance can make sure life goes on for them , even when your life does not go on for you . Quality number two : the happy life insurance shopper understands that the time to buy is now . Everyone knows we all die sometime . For most of us , though , death is something that happens to someone else - until it strikes home . Maybe someone close to us gets really sick , or we ourselves have a brush with death that wakes us up . But up to that point , we just dont want to think about it . We also convince ourselves that if we stay in shape , eat right , manage our stress , and maintain a good attitude , we can forestall the inevitable . The fact of the matter is that if we really thought about it , there are a whole slew of hazards that are entirely beyond our control . Heres a few that come to mind : Freak household accidents . Violent crime . Natural disasters . Car crashes . Of course we all say that odds are against any of these happening to us . We even say to ourselves that we can afford to wait and buy a policy next year or the year after , so we can qualify for a better rate . But in the meantime , things can happen . And they do . All the time . Unexpectedly . If your time comes before you have a policy in force , then your beneficiaries lose out . You really cant afford to die until that coverage is in place . Quality number three : the happy life insurance shopper wants a guaranteed return on his or her money . OK . Now you know you need to get coverage in force as soon as possible because you never know when your time will come . The next logical question is : for how long do you keep the coverage in force ? Easy answer : for as long as you live . You know at some point you will have your last day on this earth , so that means you know for sure your beneficiary will get their money when your time comes ... ... as long as the policy is still in force . That means you need permanent coverage . The policy should last as long as you do . Doesnt permanent coverage cost more then term coverage ? Yes . Isnt term good for short-term needs ? Yes . Can you buy term and then purchase permanent when you can afford it ? Yes . Does it make sense to buy term now and then convert to a permanent product ? Yes . The thing is , if you dont take a long-term strategy , then you wont be guaranteed a payout . If you do take a long-term strategy , then you will . Guaranteed by a top-flight financial institution . Quality number four : the happy life insurance shopper knows what hes getting into . When you buy a house , do you expect to write a check for the purchase price agreed on ? Of course you do . Same when you buy a business , book a cruise , and buy a pair of shoes . We even demand that a grocery store clerk honors the price on the shelf if an item has been mislabeled . Life insurance should operate the same way . Hard to believe , isnt it ? All too often , a broker will submit an application on the hope and prayer that the applicant will be approved at the rate quoted . We wont know what the price really will be until you are approved . Yes , right , but if you go through full disclosure on a preliminary basis , you can become confident in what that price will be . The broker has to prequalify you and present carriers with thorough and accurate quote information upfront . They can then commit to a price , contingent upon information obtained in underwriting not contradicting the preliminary disclosures . You can then be sure of what you are buying . If you dont get prequalified , then you cant be sure . Simple as that . Quality number five : the happy life insurance shopper wants to be heard . There are a few companies out there who let consumers call them and buy policies . Thats nice for a tiny percentage of the zillions of men and women who need coverage . The rest of us need personalized service and a guide to walk us through the vast marketplace of potential carriers . Only one or two of them will be the best for us , and that broker has to lead the way to their doorstep . But life insurance distribution can be pretty rigid . The broker usually does not have direct access to the carriers . He or she must work through carrier general agencies who act as wholesalers of their products . So there is you , your broker , his or her general agent , and their carrier . I am sure you have played that telephone game where one person in the line passes down a message , and by the time it reaches the end , its completely different . Its the brokers job to make sure all information about you that is passed along the underwriting channels remains consistent and is fairly assessed . He or she is your advocate , and must be prepared to carry your cause over any and all hurdles that pop up in underwriting . And they do pop up . All the time . If you have been properly prequalified for coverage , then the bottom line is this : you should be approved at the rate quoted unless information arises in underwriting that is substantially different from the information that was disclosed on a preliminary basis . Your broker is your advocate to make sure that happens . In my humble opinion , this is how you buy life insurance . If you follow this path , you will be one happy camper :-RRB- "}

So for greater coverage you can review Medicare Supplements and Advantage plans and see which one would best suit your needs . There are several choices in levels of coverage to choose from . Perhaps the most basic difference between Medicare supplements and Advantage plans is choice of where to go . With a Medicare Supplement , the insured can choose whom to see , change their minds , see somebody else and not be hampered .

The premiums are said to be `` flexible '' , because you can overpay , pay the suggested premium , pay less than the suggested , or skip altogether one month .

{"input": "Is Life Insurance Money Considered Income? ", "output": "Life insurance death benefit proceeds received by a beneficiary in most cases are income tax-free . This is a key feature of life insurance . Exceptions include business-owned life insurance issued , or materially modified , after August 17 , 2006 which may be taxable unless specific steps are taken during time of application and annually thereafter . Life insurance contracts with three parties involved may also have unexpected taxable implications . Ask a life insurance professional if these might apply . If the policy-owner accesses cash values via withdrawals of some of the cash value -LRB- after policy year 15 -RRB- , the amounts are income tax-free return of basis -LRB- premiums paid -RRB- in the contract . After that , the gain would be income taxable . Special tax rules exist for distributions in the first 15 policy years . If the policy-owner accesses cash values by taking a policy loan , the amounts would be income tax-free . As long as the policy is not lapsed prior to the net death benefit being paid , the policy loans are never taxed . If there is a large loan and the policy is allowed to lapse , income tax would be due that year on all of the gain in the contract .

Ideally enough to replace all the stuff you have that makes up your life . Clothes , furniture , dishes , jewelry , food , books , recreational toys , etc. . Your list will be unique to you . How much insurance you purchase is important but so isnt the type of coverage you purchase and the insurer you purchase the policy from . Basic renters policies will reimburse you for the Actual Cash Value of your damaged property . That means the value of used clothing , used furniture , an old computer . You , on the other hand , will most likely need to replace your damaged property with new items . The difference between new and old is often significant . Make sure whatever limit you buy includes Replacement Cost coverage . Under this type of coverage , you are entitled to claim the value of a new item should you actually replace it with one of similar kind and quality . Of course , the most the insurer will pay will be the limit you select . If you can afford it , that limit should be at least what you would have to spend to replace all those items you could not get along without . Most renters policies provide property coverage on a Named Peril basis . In other words , the policy will state the specific type of damage your property will be covered for . To be covered you have to prove to the insurer one of the covered perils caused the damage , a process not everyone is comfortable with . It is good to have someone on your side when this occurs . Often you cant find that person that sold you your coverage on the phone or over the Internet when you have a claim . Its nice to have a local person to seek assistance from . Watch out for limitations on specific types of property . Youll most likely find one for the theft of jewelry or silver , and jewelry often includes costume jewelry . Some of these limitations can be increased for a nominal premium or your can specifically insure unusual or expensive items . Personal liability coverage will also be provided . That limit should be not less than $ 100,000 and consistent with limits you might carry on your car insurance . "}

{"input": "What Is Mobile Home Insurance? ", "output": "Mobile Home Insurance is the same concept as homeowner 's insurance for site-built homes ; however , the coverage is usually only provided by specialty companies for various reasons , which I will discuss infra . Mobile Home Insurance typically mirrors a homeowner 's policy in the fact that it has coverage for the dwelling , other structures , personal property , loss of use , personal/premises liability , and all the optional coverages such as identity theft , personal injury , etc. . Mobile Home insurance is usually only provided by specialty companies such as Foremost , American Modern , American Reliable , Aegis , etc. . Mobile homes present a unique loss exposure . Site-built homes are usually constructed much better than mobiles/manufactured homes , and site-built homes have a variety of fire-resistant materials used in them . Mobile homes , on the other hand , typically dry up fairly quickly ; and it is not unusual to see a small fire cause a total loss in a mobile over 15 years old , as the mobile has then become a tinderbox . Mobiles also can vary on the foundation , depending on local building codes . For instance , in California , mobiles are not subject to state building codes . So each county assessor 's office determines what qualifies as a `` permanent foundation . '' One county requires a full concrete perimeter foundation with earthquake retroffiting -LRB- i.e. bolting -RRB- , whereas another county will allow the homeowner to lay down a strip of gravel , stack some cinderblocks , and set the mobile on it . This inconsistency makes profitable underwriting somewhat challenging . It can be tricky purchasing mobile home insurance as many agents try to sell a depreciated value policy . Mobile homes are the one coverage that do not use `` replacement cost '' as determined by contractor labor plus materials to repair or replace . Replacement cost policies for mobile homes are based on the purchase price for a brand new mobile of like kind and quality plus transportation and installation . After 10 years of age or so , many mobile homeowners claim they would not want a new mobile anyway , they would go purchase a used one ; therefore , they do not buy replacement cost , they only buy depreciated value . While this can be a significant savings on your annual premium , the likelihood of a total loss is much higher in a mobile than in a site-built home ; and the danger is that you would only get paid $ 5,000 - $ 10,000 . Good luck purchasing one and transporting/installing it onto your property for that amount . "}

Obviously these are issues that should be discussed with a qualified estate planning attorney . If you do n't know one , chances are that your life insurance agent will be able to refer you to one .

Then the child reaches a prescribed age , generally 21 , the face of the policy is increased automatically without the imposition of either an additional premium charge or a medical examination . The other reason for purchasing life insurance on one 's baby would be for a college funding vehicle .

A beneficiary designation is n't subject to those types of challenges . Assets of the probate estate are subject to the claims of creditors of the estate ; life insurance proceeds paid to the insured 's estate may get depleted to repay debts before the intended heirs receive any benefit .

If they are married and filing jointly they are phased out if their income is $ 0-10 ,000 . The point is , not everyone can contribute to a Roth IRA . When money will be taxed becomes the last major consideration . Because contributions are made with money that has already been taxed it is wise to make sure that it will be withdrawn when the marginal tax rate will be higher . This can not be determined with complete accuracy because tax policy changes from time to time , however , many working people are in a very low marginal tax bracket . These tax payers often are taking deductions for children , mortgage and a variety of other reasons . More mature tax payers dont always have those deductions available . Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are not includable in gross income . Even the earnings are tax-free . In a traditional IRA they are tax-deferred . A qualified distribution can be made after the plan has been in effect five years beginning with the first taxable year for which the individual made a contribution to a Roth IRA and the distribution meets the following requirements : 1 . It is made on or after the date on which the individual attains the age of 59.5 . 2 . It is made to a beneficiary -LRB- or to the estate of the individual -RRB- or after the death of the individual 3 . It is attributable to the individuals being disabled -LRB- see IRC Section 72 -LRB- m -RRB- -LRB- 7 -RRB- 4 . It is a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution -LRB- subject to IRC rules . -RRB- It would appear that younger tax payers in low tax brackets should consider putting money into a Roth IRA . Because retirement seems to be a distant dream many young people are reluctant to start a Roth IRA , however , there is great wisdom in doing so . These younger tax payers are also more likely to have incomes that are below the limits mentioned previously . A distribution of a regular IRA is subject to taxation as ordinary income and may be subject to penalty tax if the distribution doesnt meet specified criteria . A distribution from a Roth IRA is considered a return of premium and not subject to income tax . Income taxation only becomes an issue if the amount returned exceeds that which was deposited . If specified criteria are met , even the growth or interest in the Roth IRA is also free of income tax . Distributions from most retirement plans are taxed as ordinary income . It is very helpful to have a source of tax free distributions . This is the role that the Roth IRA can play . A Roth IRA can accept rollovers from other qualified plans . In these events immediate income tax must be paid on the amount being transferred to the Roth IRA . The money is treated as ordinary income at the time of the rollover . These provisions may provide significant opportunities for retirement income planning . Most people start to consider the Roth IRA when they reach age 45 . They realize then that they will want the tax free benefit of the distribution . While it is never too late to start it would be to the interest of most tax payers to start earlier . "}

He understood that he could never have built his business empire without the dedication , hard work , and loyalty of each and every one of those men and women . He took good care of them .

We need each other in times of natural disasters , and human tragedy , and family distress . When people lose their job , or get sick , or maybe lose their home , they need a helping hand .

He made sure that families who were suffering had the means to weather the storm and remain together . When people in need came to him , he helped them get back on to their own two feet . He was an extremely dedicated family man . He loved his wife dearly . He was always there for his children . Everything he did was really for them . He wanted them to have the best of everything . He especially wanted his son and daughter to have a great jump-start in life . His entire estate the houses , the businesses , the valuables - was going to go to them when he passed away . One day he had a lunch meeting with his friend who was an estate planning attorney . His friend made the following observation : You know , you are quite a person . You have done such a tremendous job building a life for yourself . All the people you employ , all the people you help . How fortunate your family is to have you as a provider . But heres the problem : God forbid you die tomorrow , this entire wonderful world you have built collapses . Without you and your broad shoulders , the entire enterprise stops in its tracks . You can imagine that our friend the Rich Man didnt like hearing that at all . He had indeed put so much of himself into what he held to be precious . It would almost be an act of betrayal for them to lose it all when he died . I mean , shouldnt he make provisions for their care after his death ? Why shouldnt the show go on ? So many people have become dependent on him . So , he bought a bunch of life insurance . Life insurance to make sure his family wouldnt have to sell half his assets just to pay the governments estate tax bill . They wouldnt have to sell the residences or family jewels . The heirlooms could stay in the family . He bought life insurance to enable his businesses to keep running . People would be able to keep their jobs . Vendors would get paid . Clients would receive service . The management team would have enough money to keep going and growing . He bought life insurance to fill the coffers of charities doing noble work in his community . Hungry people could get fed . Homeless people could get shelter . Unemployed people get retrained for new jobs . Life insurance made it possible for the great work this man had been doing to continue . And because life insurance is such a great deal financially , the cost of this planning was literally pennies on the dollar . Each dollar of life insurance benefit literally cost him a few cents . Of course , it was this financial wisdom and eagerness to take advantage of a great deal that made him rich in the first place :-RRB- Would you like to keep learning ?

{"input": "Where Should I Invest If I Cannot Use A Roth IRA? ", "output": "There are important reasons why you would be interested in having a Roth IRA . Participation is restricted by income which results in many people who really need the benefits of a Roth IRA being unable to open an account . You probably appreciate that the Roth IRA pays benefits after age 59.5 that can be received income tax free . Other qualified plans tax the entire distribution as current income . Unlike a traditional IRA , 403 -LRB- b -RRB- , 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and other plans there arent any mandatory distributions at age 70.5 . These mandatory distributions are fully taxable as ordinary income . The Roth IRA also provides tax benefits that would pass to beneficiaries should you die prior to exhausting your Roth IRA . If you decide to use the funds in the IRA for educational expenses , for a child or yourself , there isnt the 10 % penalty tax assessed as there is in the case of the traditional IRA . You can use the funds for helping in the event of a disability , or use the money for a first-time home purchase , without penalty or tax if the plan has been in effect for more than five years . An easy way to invest in a Roth IRA is to open a regular IRA and when you are done making contributions , convert it to a Roth IRA . You would be taxed on the value of the traditional IRA as though it were current income , however , with some planning you could probably arrange for that to have the same impact that you would have experienced with making the Roth IRA contributions currently . If you have an employer sponsored plan you should contact the plan administrator and tell them that you want a Roth option for their plan . This is not unusual in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and 403 -LRB- b -RRB- plans . The money could be invested in a Roth 403 -LRB- b -RRB- for example and receive the same treatment as the Roth IRA . The contribution limits would be much higher . The employer might consider this plan particularly advantageous to the more highly compensated employees , but it is a great benefit for all employees . The Third Party Administrator for your employers sponsored plan probably has the language already prepared to institute a Roth option . The fact that so few plans offer a Roth option is due to poor communications . This should be an option that your employer would favor . Your senior people will love the option . It would be a great benefit for all the employees . A permanent life insurance policy has many of the same characteristics of the Roth IRA . Much like the Roth IRA the premiums are paid with after tax dollars . There isnt any current tax deduction for the deposit . In the same way the life insurance policy and Roth IRA provide for a tax deferred -LRB- and ultimately tax-free -RRB- accumulation of cash inside the policy . With the life insurance policy there isnt any restriction on borrowing the money from the cash value . The careful use of loans can result in recovering the cash value without paying income tax . Universal life insurance policies and variable life insurance policies have the ability to accumulate significant amounts of money in this way . Unlike the Roth IRA there arent any income restrictions to participating in a life insurance policy . There isnt a restriction on the amount that you put into the plan . Contributions are at your discretion . Of course the life insurance policy is also self-completing should you die before reaching withdrawing benefits . The variable life insurance policies also afford a person with the option of selecting a mix of security based solutions that will rise and fall with the market . Again , this is similar to some of the investment characteristics found in Roth IRA vehicles . "}

{"input": "How Much Home Insurance Should I Buy? ", "output": "Short answer is the amount that is correct to adequately cover your Home , Personal Property and Liability exposure .

Finally , choose the amount of Liability coverage that best suits your financial exposure as this is protection against any possible action or inaction for which you may be held legally liable . "}
{"input": "How Much Home Insurance Should I Buy? ", "output": "Home insurance is really pretty simple . There are 6 basic coverage parts : Coverage A : Dwelling -LRB- the actual home -RRB- Coverage B : Other Structures -LRB- any detached buildings -RRB- Coverage C : Personal Property -LRB- your `` stuff '' -RRB- Coverage D : Loss of Use Coverage E : Personal Liability -LRB- if your sued -RRB- Coverage F : Medical Payments Coverage A , the dwelling , is the coverage that the other property coverages are calculated from . The right amount depends on the home and how you want claims to be settled . The two basic settlement options are Replacement Cost or Actual Cash Value . Replacement cost is the amount it would take to rebuild your home just like it is . Actual Cash Value is the amount your home is worth . Most people want their home replaced if it 's damaged so most will use Replacement Cost . There is an industry standard estimator that insurance companies use to estimate this . Your insurance agent will be able to estimate this based on the construction and features of your home . Actual Cash Value will take that number and depreciate it . Getting the dwelling amount right is the most important calculation for your insurance . Coverage B is usually 10 % of Coverage A and Coverage C is usually anywhere from 50 % -75 % of Coverage A. Coverage D can be anywhere from 20 % of Coverage A to unlimited . Every company is different . Coverage E is also a very important coverage as this protects your assets in the case someone sues you . How much is right for you ? I usually insure the home for it 's replacement cost and I usually recommend a Personal Liability Limit of at least $ 500,000 . Find an agent you can trust and he/she will be happy to show you many different options and how that computes to premiums . Then you can make an informed decision . "}
{"input": "Why Is Life Insurance Not A Contract Of Indemnity? ", "output": "Life insurance is not a contract of indemnity because it is the other type of insurance contract , a `` valued contract '' . Indemnity insurance pays a benefit equal to the financial loss and seeks to return the insured to their original financial position . It is impossible to succinctly assess the value of a life , to insure it with an indemnity contract . A valued contract pays a stated sum , regardless of the loss incurred , which is how life insurance operates . "}
{"input": "Why Is Life Insurance Not A Contract Of Indemnity? ", "output": "Its an interesting question . Lets take a look at some indemnity agreements and see what we can learn . I am sure you have heard of the bird flu epidemic . I know that the price of eggs has skyrocketed and that has been reflected in the price of baked goods , and everything else that uses eggs . The federal government is stepping in and indemnifying the losses being sustained by agricultural companies to help them remain viable . They can put a hard number on the value of their loss . Frankly , I think the bailout of Wall Street a few years ago was one huge act of indemnification by the government . Thats a topic for another time . War reparations are a form of indemnity . Germany was forced to pay extensive indemnity after its role in World War I. Im sure the actuaries and examiners had a field day adding up the damage . Sometimes you hear about nations that break away from an Empire , such as Haiti from France , having to pay indemnity to cover losses sustained by the parent nation in taxes , etc. . Pretty easy to put a number on that . Homeowners are identified against structural damage and other losses when they take out a homeowners policy . Should disasters like a bad storm occur , the insurance benefit will help the policyowner restore the home to its original state . Also easy here to identify the monetary cost I think we can see a pattern here . Indemnification agreements make a party whole ; they compensate for losses to restore the aggrieved party to its original state of affairs financially . Accurate , current numbers are used . I can see how one would think that life insurance is a form of indemnification . You are , after all , trying to compensate for losses . If the breadwinner of the family makes $ 100,000 a year , then that income would be lost if he or she tragically dies . A $ 1 million life insurance benefit would make up for that loss , at least for 10 years worth . The difference is that you dont have to prove the lost . When the breadwinner dies , he or she could have been making $ 10,000 per year or $ 10 million per year . Regardless , the benefit remains $ 1 million . So life insurance is considered a valued policy or contract . As such , it is very unique . The insured is underwritten at the time of claim , and thats that . At the risk of loss could then go up dramatically , but that benefit will remain the same . "}

{"input": "Can You Get Health Insurance For Significant Other? ", "output": "Great question ! Unfortunately , I would need a little more information from you . Are you talking same sex partner ? If so , that would depend upon whether the state you live in recognizes same sex relationships , and the providers stand on the issue .

{"input": "Can You Get Health Insurance For Significant Other? ", "output": "Well , itapparently depends upon what sex your significant other is . If you are a man and woman living together in a committed relationship but not married , unless your employer 's policy allows for coverage in such situations then theanswer is generally `` No '' and it appears it will be that way going forward . If , however , you are a same sex couple in a committed relationship then in some states this is already accepted . And , a March 14 , 2014 announcement from Health and Human Services will essentially require all health plans that offer coverage for married heterosexual couples to do so for same sex couples married in a jurisdiction that recognizes same sex marriages . This requirement goes into effect on January 1 , 2015 but the Obama administration is encouraging employers to voluntarily comply with this rule before then . Larger , self-insured employers had already been operating under similar rules issued by the Department of Labor last fall . Of course , not every state recognizes same sex marriages . So , you still need to do some homework on your particular situation in your state of residence and the individual or group health insurance contracts issued there . I can see where the need for a domestic partnership agreement will be a good idea in some states but clearly the requirements for health insurance plans regulated under the Affordable Care Act have moved to recognize same sex marriage as being on a par with heterosexual marriage . But a couple just living together with no formal legal commitments , regardless of sexual orientation , would appear to be much more problematic and that kind of `` significant other '' would probably not meet the requirements of being a legitimate dependent under the law .

Some companies are really good about supplemental income ; their cash values are really good and they have a good track record of accumulating wealth . You want to look at ` what is the reason ? What is the area ? ' Each area has their own forte . Some people want highly-rated carriers , so you 're going to look at the big financial strength of a carrier or the carrier 's claims - paying ability . Any of those areas are separate areas of discussion and that 's why it 's difficult to ever say , `` Here 's one , or here 's the best .

{"input": "Which Life Insurance Company Is The Best? ", "output": "Which life insurance company is the best ? I think that depends on a few factors . Chief among them are the risk profile you present , and the type of product you want to purchase . At the end of the day , it becomes a question of which will give you the best underwriting . Your risk profile is characterized by the underwriting challenges you pose . I am sure you know that life insurance underwriting covers many factors . These include gender ; nicotine use ; current health ; medical history ; family medical history ; occupation ; avocation ; foreign travel history and plans ; lifestyle with regards to alcohol and drug use ; financial situation ; and criminal , financial , and motor vehicle record . Much to look at . And you know what ? In some way , shape , or form , all these factors can have an impact on your mortality . For most people , one or more of these factors are more operative than the others . Therefore you need to look for a company who will be most competitive in underwriting that particular risk factor . Some companies will be more competitive for diabetics . Some companies will be more competitive for people with a cancer history . Some companies will be more competitive for mountain climbers . Some companies will be more competitive for scuba divers . Some companies will be more competitive for people with a bankruptcy on their record . And on and on and on . It is the job of your broker to direct you to the right company . Also remember that companies tend to specialize in the products they manufacture . Some lean towards cheap term insurance . Others lean towards whole life insurance . Some lean towards guaranteed universal life insurance , while others lean towards interest-based universal life insurance . Once your broker prequalifies you and identifies the company that will give you the lowest cost for your coverage , you can then determine which product they make available that would make the most sense , given the life insurance strategy you want to employ . Important note : given that not every company makes available every type of product , you might have to re-think your choice of product once you find out which company will give you the best underwriting . But that is OK at least you will be getting the most value for your dollar . "}
{"input": "Which Life Insurance Company Is The Best? ", "output": "There are rating agencies that make it their whole purpose to show you which life insurance companies are best .

When you go to the About Us section of any life insurance company 's website , they will usually show you their ratings , and give an explanation of what that rating means . "}
{"input": "How Much Should Health Insurance Cost Per Month? ", "output": "How much you should be paying is a hard figure to try and quantify . The average cost in the country for a health insurance plan is $ 328 per month - however , this is only reflective upon a silver level plan -LRB- not all 2014 state figure averages are available yet -RRB- . While you can try to come up with an `` average '' cost , there 's too many factors that go into premium pricing to say how in relation that compares to you . In short , an `` average '' premium is a rather useless figure to the individual . It 's only representative to a large group - you could have people paying a small nominal amount -LRB- after factoring in subsidies -RRB- per month to several thousand dollars per month . Even for that there 's a ton of information to sift through to get an accurate representation . Under the new Affordable Care Act , you have the options for bronze , silver , gold , and platinum level plans -LRB- as you go up in metal , the price goes up , but provides better benefits -RRB- - some areas also have a catastrophic plan available . In addition , your age is a big factor as well . The younger you are , the cheaper your premium - the older you are , the higher your premium . Also , if you use tobacco products , your premium can be increased up to 50 % as well . You may be able to qualify for a subsidy that can be used to reduce the cost of your health insurance premiums . I always recommend consulting with an experienced broker .

{"input": "A Whole Life Policy Owner Passed Away With Cash Surrender Value Higher Than The Death Benefit. Which Amount Will The Beneficiary Get? ", "output": "Another possibility is life insurance that has violated the corridors of risk and has been allowed to become , or was originally intended to be , a Modified Endowment Contract -LRB- MEC -RRB- . The corridor of risk applies usually to universal life insurance type policies and it is the established maximum cash surrender value of the contract as it pertains to the amount of coverage and the age of the insured . The tests prescribed by the IRS limits what remains life insurance and what gets treated as a MEC . Regulations established in the 1980 's limited this risk of abusing life insurance in this way because people discovered that universal life policies could be a great place to stash cash through the payment of excess premium in the flexible universal life policy , of which the IRS did n't like much When a life insurance policy becomes a MEC it is still a life insurance policy for death . Any pre-death distributions , however , cause the policy to be treated more like an annuity and distributions are treated as income first . That limits the use of the funds during the life of the insured . Life insurance treats policy loans as the payment of the basis -LRB- premiums paid in -RRB- first , and this feature is lost when a policy becomes a MEC . In fact , a number of tax-favorable benefits of life insurance are lost . To determine if a life policy has become a MEC , premiums are compared on a 7-pay test that helps establish the amount of premium , after paying 7 level annual premium amounts , that would pay up the policy in the first seven years after the life policy was issued . Being subjected to the 7-pay test or MEC test can occur well after the first seven years if there has been a material change in the policy . However , despite all of the latter , a life insurance policy that is stuffed with cash and violates the 7-pay MEC test down the road , has specific advantages even considering the disadvantages . One of those advantages is having more cash value than the face amount of coverage at death so you should also consider whether this life insurance became a MEC due to some specific financial or estate planning course of action taken by the decedent . Money at death under life insurance made to be a MEC are usually deliberate planning moves to pass cash or benefits of cash beyond the next immediate generation . For example , Grandpa wants to give each grandchild a sizable sum of money but wants to avoid generation skipping taxation . A MEC that pays as a death benefit is a contract paid , rather than money given . Check it out but this is another possibility for life insurance with too much cash value ! "}

One of the foundation principals of any insurance is referred to as `` the law of large numbers '' .

{"input": "Can The United States Government Force You To Buy Health Insurance? ", "output": "Boy , what a question . For me , it gets to the root of what is wrong with government these days . Im going to speak bluntly because I feel very strongly about this issue . Even though I sell life insurance for a living , I have had extensive experience in the medical insurance marketplace . I am also a consumer , and have to buy the product for myself and my family . And , I am a patriotic American who wants to see our country run the way it should be . Everybody needs medical care . If the insurance marketplace is left to run by its own devices , the vast majority of people will end up with a product that they like , at a price they can afford . If a small minority of people end up without coverage for whatever reason , their needs can be easily addressed . This could take place with a government safety net , an innovation by private companies , or some combination of the above . Either way , everyone will be able to have some form of coverage so that the cost of getting medical attention could be kept affordable . Beyond making sure that healthcare products and services are safe and secure , I cant see why government invention would be needed at all to make this system work . Next point : nobody is entitled to medical insurance . Frankly , nobody is entitled to anything . A government should not be in the business of providing the stuff to which we think we are entitled . The whole notion of government taking care of you from cradle-to-grave is horribly misguided . A gargantuan state and federal bureaucracy can in no way give each and every man , woman and child the treatment they deserve every day of their life . Last point : giving this gargantuan bureaucracy the legal power to force you to do business with it is a travesty of justice . We have made a horrible mistake by giving the federal government the right to tax or penalize us when purchasing health insurance . We have let it get much too cozy with the corporate providers of healthcare . Who exactly is benefiting by this illicit partnership ? Is it you ? Is it me ? Do we actually have the health insurance we need at a price we can afford ? Many Americans do not . So the answer to your question is yes , the United States government can force you to buy health insurance , and we have nobody to blame but ourselves for this sorry state of affairs . "}

The best place to start is to contact an independent agent that specializes in Medicare Supplement plans . A good agent will be able to show you all top rated plans available to you and analyze your needs to help you determine which plan is best for you . If done correctly , the whole process will seem easy . Plan F is the most comprehensive plan but it may not be the right fit for you . There are Medicare plans similar to Plan F but the premium can be a lot less . "}
{"input": "What Medicare Plan Is Best? ", "output": "Plan F is the most popular Medigap plan . Before buying one , you first want to research the types of benefits available under a Medigap plan , decide which of these benefits you want , and then select the Medigap policy that meets these needs . All of the Medigap plans are standardized so the benefits under a given plan is the EXACT same from every carrier . So how do they differentiate themselves in that type of marketplace ? They feature different rates , rating methods - community rated , issue age rated , and attained age rated , and value added services -LRB- e.g. UHC plan members can get discounts for vision or dental services and access to the senior sneakers program through AARP -RRB- . A lot of people think `` Why do n't I just get a plan F ? All of the benefits available are included in that plan ! '' While this is true , this plan is also going to be the most expensive . If you 're on a fixed income , you may want to try to keep your cost down . Therefore , a different plan may be more appropriate for you . For example , a plan G offers all of the same benefits as a plan F , except for the Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 for 2014 -RRB- . However , a plan G is going to be cheaper than a plan F -LRB- and usually by a good margin -RRB- . Plan N can also reduce premiums by a substantial margin and offer great coverage as well - the difference from plans F & G being a small copay is due when you go to the doctor -LRB- up to a $ 20 copay -RRB- or the hospital -LRB- up to a $ 50 copay -RRB- and excess charges are not covered . Plan N is most useful for someone who 's doctors accept Medicare and accepts assignment -LRB- when accepting assignment , a doctor accepts the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full and can not bill you an excess charge -RRB- . Another major point to keep in mind is where your health is now and where it may be in the future because you might not be able to switch to another Medigap plan later if your health drastically changed down the line , you may not be able to qualify for a new plan if medical underwriting is required . The rating method a carrier uses is an important factor to consider here . You also need to find out which carriers offer the plan in your area . Remember to keep in mind that not every carrier offers every plan . As there are many health care plan options available to seniors , it 's most helpful for you to work with an experienced broker who can guide you through all of these steps .

Failing to declare the existence of other insurance may void your coverage entirely . If other insurance is available , the policy will outline how the claim would be addressed . In some situations , like property coverage , each company would `` share '' the loss . In others , each insurer may share the loss or one policy would be considered `` excess '' of the other and payment would be made only when one policy 's limit is exhausted .

In these cases the excess gains would be subject to ordinary income taxes . I highly recommend talking over options with your agent , advisor or insurance carrier before making a costly decision . "}
{"input": "How Much Tax Do You Pay On A Life Insurance Policy? ", "output": "The only taxed dollars usually on an insurance policy are those used to pay the premium . The death benefit is usually income tax free . I use the word usually because there are always exceptions to the rules depending on the situation . Generally , the IRS wants a tax paid on either the money going in or the money coming out . So your retirement plan allows you to write off the money paid into the plan while it 's growing . Then when you start to withdraw those funds , the IRS applies taxes to them . Life insurance works in the opposite direction . You pay taxes on the premium collected and none on the death benefit and depending on what type of policy you 've purchased and how you 've structured it anywhere from `` none '' to some on the gains . That is why some people choose to use a life policy as a supplement to their retirement plan . The combination creates the opportunity to minimize taxes at the start and finish of your plan . "}

"}
{"input": "Why Is The Market For Long-Term Care Insurance So Small? ", "output": "In my opinion there are three factors that regulate the size of the long-term care insurance market : - Fear . No one wants to consider , discuss , or especially visualize themselves as unable to take care of normal daily activities of elderly life . Its almost as if some people say , `` If I do n't think about it , it wo n't happen to me '' . There is great anxiety over whom among their relatives or close friends might end up being their caregiver . Many people are scared that they wo n't be able to afford the cost of long-term care . They simply do not want to `` go there '' . It is too scary . - Denial . `` If I ever get that way , just take me out in the back yard and shoot me '' is the classic sign of superficial denial . Such a statement is not made with any degree of sincerity , but what it really says is that the person knows it could happen and that they do not want to live that way and be a burden to their spouse of extended family . But , not to worry . There must be a government program out there that will take care old people that have nowhere to go when they ca n't take care of themselves . Certainly , in a country as rich as ours , no one will allow another to die alone or in the gutter . - Lack of experience . The vast majority of people age 45-65 have not had to care for an elderly relative or close friend . They have no idea of the psychological and emotional energy expended in taking care of a person 24/7/365 . They have never gotten an invoice from a skilled nursing service or had to go shopping for a facility and compare prices for monthly care , nor have the ever even been inside a nursing home and seen the conditions that some elderly have to endure because they did n't have a choice . To turn the question around a bit : Who are the people that do buy their own long-term care insurance ? Most of those that do have gone through personal care giving . They know the challenge . They know the commitment . They know the costs . They know the sacrifices that others in the family have to go through . They know that extended , expensive , long-term care can effect two - even three - generations.About 8 % of the American population has purchased their own long-term care insurance . About 17 % or more of that same population is going to need two years or more of skilled long-term care , either at home , or in a facility or both . Medicare is currently footing about 30-40 % of that bill . As the boomer demographic moves through the age of needed care , who is going to pay for it ? "}

{"input": "Can I Sell My Term Life Insurance Policy For Cash? ", "output": "Typically no . A term life insurance policy is rated for you individually based on your age and medical history . It carries no cash value . The only market that exists for term life insurance policies is if you are in a scenario in which your life expectancy has been seriously diminished and you are likely to die within the term policy period , for example you are diagnosed with a terminal illness such as cancer . If you are given 1 year to live and you have 10 years left on your term policy , then there may be a market to buy your policy . However , this is not a good idea as the cash you can get will be substantially lower than the death benefit on the policy . Additionally , some insurance companies , such as Liberty Mutual , include a rider in life insurance policies that grants the insured access to a portion of the death benefit in the event of a terminal illness or complete disablement . Additionally , once the policy is sold there is no recourse to regain ownership of the policy and you have no right to any portion of the death benefit . "}

For starters , it is extremely valuable coverage in the event of a loss to your personal property from perils such as fire , smoke , theft and others . It also provides some coverage for liability which can be of significant value . Other desired coverages can be economically added . From a personal standpoint , I saw the value first-hand when my Sons had a severe kitchen fire in their apartment in Raleigh , NC a few years ago . No one was hurt but the apartment became uninhabitable as a result of the fire and smoke damage . Because my Sons were astute enough to have purchased a renters policy , they were reimbursed for all of their burned and smoke-damaged possessions and they received reimbursement for living expenses elsewhere while restoration was being completed . Additionally , the landlord sued them for negligence related to the cause of the fire ... which was quickly thrown-out in court ... but the insurance carrier provided them a defense for the negligence allegation . All-in-all , it cost my Sons their very affordable premium and a small loss deductible to get back to their lives . Without the renters policy , they would have been ` hurting ' for a long time "}

To make sure that the landlord and you dont have misunderstandings and that the expense for the lawsuit is handled properly , the landlord is making it a requirement of your tenancy to maintain a renters policy and probably is requiring that he be named as an additional insured .

Coverage A - Dwelling : This is the primary coverage for the policy and dictates the amount of some of the other included coverage limits . This is the amount that the insurance company will pay up to in the case of any claims . From a simple window breakage due to storm damage , or a total loss due to fire , the maximum the policy will pay during any one policy period -LRB- typically a year -RRB- would be the amount shown on this coverage Coverage B - Other Structures : This coverage is for fences , detached garages , unattached decks or gazebos and etc. . The limit on this coverage is typically a percentage of Coverage A , for example 10 % of the amount of your dwelling limits . This coverage is in addition to Coverage A , meaning if a loss damaged more than just the dwelling , you can collect on both . Coverage C - Personal Property : This is the limit the policy will pay to replace your belongings , furniture , clothing , and etc. . Typically this is 50 % of Coverage A , and again this is in addition to Coverage A. Coverage D - Loss of Use : If there was a claim initiated on your property , and you had to find temporary residence while repairs were being made , or the home was simply no longer livable , this would be the coverage that would apply . Typically this is 30 % of Coverage A and would be in addition as well . On top of these coverage limits , you can have additional coverage through either automatically included or optional extensions of coverage . These can include , but are not limited to : Debris Removal ; Cyber Theft Protection ; Credit Card and Forgery ; Trees , Shrubs and Plants ; Fire Department Service Charge ; Ordinance or Law ; Glass Breakage ; and additional riders to increase personal property coverage above limits . For example , the policy might restrict replacement of Money/Gold/Coins to only $ 200 per claim . Or Jewelry , Furs , Precious Stones to $ 1000 per item / $ 5000 per claim . These riders would increase coverage for those specific items you might have that are of greater value . Finally , there is coverage for Personal Liability , which is included in most policies , but is not calculated as a percentage of Coverage A. Typically the limits provided for this coverage start at $ 100,000 and can be as high as $ 1,000,000 or more in some States . This coverage would apply if you were ever personally sued for any activity other than a vehicle accident , as your auto policy would cover that . I know that 's a lot to think about .

Let them learn on other people . Also ask if the are independent or work mainly for one company . If they work mainly with one company , that 's not good unless you do n't care about price and value . Your agent is free for you . Interview several . Fire them if they do n't fit well with you . Use them to your benefit . "}
{"input": "Are Insurance Agents Necessary? ", "output": "Insurance is a personal product . One size doesnt fit everyone . The most important part of the insurance buying process is setting the limits . If a policy fails to provide the necessary protection when you experience a loss , you will be dissatisfied and you will have paid far too much for your coverage . A trusted agent will listen to you , offer sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and the insurance company . His advice in setting limits offsets any savings you might get through an alternative distribution system . "}
{"input": "Are Insurance Agents Necessary? ", "output": "As a big do it yourselfer , the answer is maybe ? It depends on what your situation is and how adept you are on gathering information and making a good decision from all the information out there . I mean I like to work on my cars and trucks . I can do many things myself and feel really good about it . However , I do still use my trusted mechanic for the things I simply am not good enough to do myself and that way I avoid putting my family at risk . As another noted , there are absolutely no price savings in going without an agent . The laws in most states prevent any discounting for doing it yourself . It never ever hurts to become informed about a product . I have taught my son the doctor , how to frame a house , wire a house and have a general understanding about construction . He 's a doctor now , and yes , that is fun to say , he has learned enough about how to build that when he decides to build , he can have a good conversation with a builder and know when to call shenanigans or not . By all means it pays to educate yourself , but understand that an open mind is required to educate yourself . "}

However from my experience most clients still do not understand thecoverage ` sthey are purchasing and often leave huge gaps in their coverage . Also has a clients portfolio builds and insurance needs become greater an agents knowledge and experience becomes invaluable in offering protection to consumers . Now as it pertains to business this is something that takes years of educating just for agents .

The wrong coverage for your business can destroy your entire livelyhood . "}
{"input": "Are Insurance Agents Necessary? ", "output": "You can buy all types of insurance without an agent , but as an independent agent myself , I like to think that I can bring a certain level of knowledge to the client that is n't easily obtained via other means , such as the internet . As some have said , people tend to look at the insurance carrier as a primary driver of what to choose , but there are so many other factors to be considered . In cases where full medical underwriting is involved , I can quickly give someone an idea of how different companies might view a health problem and set the expectation of what may happen to the rate in the end . While one company may increase the final rate for a given condition , another company might offer a policy at the standard rate . Also , having had lots of other client experiences to draw from and company contacts at the various carriers , I can offer help navigating the system after the purchase is made . Education , guidance and service is what I provide for no more than you 'd pay buying direct . So , you may not `` need '' someone like me - but you certainly might `` want '' the services I can provide . "}
{"input": "Are Insurance Agents Necessary? ", "output": "I love this question ! The answer is found all over the internet . Yes , the same internet that you used to buy insurance . Look at the reviews on Yelp and others to see what kind of feedback -LRB- complaints -RRB- people are posting . The moment you begin to choose your insurance based solely on the price , you 'll begin to run into problems . Claims not handled to your satisfaction and the inability to get anyone on this continent to talk to you about it . You may save a few bucks when you purchase your insurance but you 'll lose in the long run . A good agent does something a website can never do ... care . If you have a problem with the way my company handles a claim you can walk right into my office and talk with me , and I 'll listen and do whatever I can to make you happy . I 'm accountable for the services that I provide . Flo or the Gecko will try to sell you on the idea that all insurance is the same and the price is the only thing that matters . Nothing could be further from the truth . Will Flo tell you that you 're grossly underinsured and , god forbid , you get sued , you could be paying for the rest of your life ? Nope . But a good agent will , and it probably would n't cost that much more . The internet has n't made the insurance agent obsolete . On the contrary , it proves why you need a good one . Insurance is n't a simple point and click product . There are many different aspects that fit together to make it work for you , and it 's different for everyone . I 've never had a client tell me I 'm overcharging them after we 've rebuilt their home . Will the lizard show up at your home at 2am when your house is still burning ? I have , it 's what I owe my clients . There are bad agents out there , I 'll admit . I 've met quite a few . However , most good agents take their responsibility seriously and they truly care about their clients . So , in summary , agents are necessary only if you want someone who cares about covering your family correctly . "}

{"input": "Is It Possible For An 89 Year Old Male To Find Life Insurance? ", "output": "That is a great question ! It is possible , but I will not mislead you , it will be difficult . The majority of insurers will cap policy writing at 80-85 ; so you will need a good independent agent who can search multiple companies for you to find one that will write at his age . The second hurdle will be his health . It would be very difficult to find a company that will write if he is in a nursing home , receiving home health care , or has had any major health issues within the past couple of years . Many will decline if he 's wheelchairbound . Again , you will need a good agent that can seek out the company that will write for you . The last hurdle will be the cost . Even if you can find the company that will write his policy , it is very likely that it will be too costly to afford . I 'd hazard a guess that it would be in the hundreds of dollars a month price range , unless his health is excellent . Life insurance is one of those things where the earlier you buy it , the cheaper it is , and it hurts me to say that far too many people either through their fault or not , end up waiting far too late to buy it . Far too many wait until there has been a scare , and then it is too late , either due to health or financial concerns .

I recommend the ACA site first , as you may qualify for a subsidy that may help with the cost for you . But act quickly , as it may be that our Government insured Supreme Court may decide that you do n't need help paying for insurance , and remove the subsidy . They are debating that even as we speak .

{"input": "I Just Lost My Job, Which Provided Health Insurance For Me. What Can I Do Now? ", "output": "I 'm sorry to hear about the loss of your job . I hope you are able to find another soon . If your company was providing health insurance they should have provided you with information about COBRA ; a way for you to continue the coverage but now you would be responsible for paying 100-101 % of the premium . If the premium is too much for you to pay , then you should look for a more affordable plan on your own . Under the Affordable Care Act there is a specific time period called Open Enrollment , which in general occurs between November and February . This is the time when individuals can enroll in a new health plan , effective January 1 . However if you have a qualifying event you can enroll in a health plan no matter what time of year . Loss of employment is a qualifying event . But you only have 63 days to take action . Get in touch with your state 's Health Connector or an insurance agent and they should be able to assist you . If you 're in Massachusetts please feel free to contact me , I 'd be happy to help . Best of luck with everything . "}
{"input": "I Just Lost My Job, Which Provided Health Insurance For Me. What Can I Do Now? ", "output": "Job loss is always a unsettling period in our lives and having to address your health insurance concerns only compounds things . The first thing you should look into is the feasibility of continuing your coverage through your former employer 's health plan under either your state 's continuation of coverage provisions or , if your employer has 20 + employees , under the Federal COBRA continuation guidelines . Unless you were terminated with cause your former employer should have provided you with information regarding your rights in this area . If you have a spouse who is employed and has health insurance coverage available through their employer this is a qualifying event for you to be added as a dependent on your spouse 's plan or for you and your spouse to both enroll in the spouse 's employer 's health plan if you had both been enrolled under your former employer 's health plan . If your spouse has access to coverage through their employer this will almost certainly make you ineligible for subsidies through the government health insurance marketplaces . Some people , especially those with family coverage , may find paying the entire premium for the former employer 's health plan to be cost prohibitive or may not want to continue be covered under it for other reasons . Losing coverage from an employer 's group health plan is a `` Qualifying Event '' that grants you a `` Special Election Period '' under the Affordable Care Act . You have a 60-day window after losing coverage to purchase individual health insurance either directly from an insurance carrier or through the state or Federal Health Insurance Marketplace in your state . The only good reason to purchase your coverage through a government health insurance marketplace is if your income level for 2015 would qualify you for a premium subsidy and possibly for cost sharing reductions . Currently a person 's qualification for these subsidies is based upon the applicant 's projected FAMILY income for all of 2015 . So , your situation is not an uncomplicated one . SEEK OUT AN EXPERIENCED HEALTH INSURANCE BROKER WHO REPRESENTS MULTIPLE INSURANCE CARRIERS AND WHO IS LICENSED TO SELL COVERAGE IN THE GOVERNMENT MARKETPLACE FOR GUIDANCE ON THESE MATTERS . If you are in good health and pre-existing condition coverage is not a concern for you , then in the event that the options I 've listed above do n't fit your financial needs , you can consider Short Term Major Medical insurance coverage as bridge coverage if you anticipate getting another job in the weeks or months ahead . These policies are usually less expensive -LRB- sometimes significantly so -RRB- than the options discussed above and can provide protection from financial ruin in the event an illness or injury occurs while the Short Term Medical policy is in effect . PLEASE NOTE : Short Term Medical policies do not meet the criteria under the Affordable Care Act for avoiding the individual mandate tax penalty so there could be tax ramifications if you are covered under such a policy for more than 90-days . This does not mean that a Short Term Medical policy is an option you should not consider but it is an option that you should choose only with a full understanding of the positives and negatives associated with this choice . Which is another reason you should seek the guidance of an experienced Health Insurance Broker . "}

The contributions you made to your Roth IRA can be withdrawn at any time , tax free because you have already paid tax on this money . However , in order to withdraw your earnings from your Roth IRA account tax and penalty free , you must be at least 59\u00a01/2 years old and the contributions to your Roth IRA must have been made at least 5 years before the withdrawal date . If you withdraw your Roth IRA earnings earlier than 5 years after the contributions , the earnings would not be considered a qualified distribution .

{"input": "Can An 80 Year Old Get Life Insurance? ", "output": "While it 's possible for an 80 year old to get life insurance , it can sometimes be a bit of a process . At 80 one might still qualify for certain simplified issue policies . Simplified issue simply means that the normal medical underwriting requirements might not be quite as invasive as they would otherwise be . If the individual is in superlative health , he or she can also entertain a fully underwritten policy , meaning he or she will undergo pretty extensive medical underwriting in order to qualify for the life insurance policy . This would be the cheaper option per dollar of death benefit purchased , but requires the proposed insured to be in excellent health .

So it is best to try and get an agent or company to understand your personal situation and then the vehicle that you need to insure.Don ' t overlook the use of the vehicle .

{"input": "Is Commercial Auto Insurance Cheaper Than Personal? ", "output": "The short answer is , `` usually not . '' Commercial auto policies are in place to provide liability and collision coverage for work related vehicles . Insurance companies view commercial autos as instruments necessary for work , which means they will be used on a daily basis . This means there will be more driving and greater exposure . Think about it this way , when you are getting personal auto insurance the insurance company will ask what is the purpose of having your vehicle and how far will you be driving . For commercial auto policies it is assumed this will be increased . I hope this helps . "}

Most personal auto policies do not have that high of limits . Now you can have a personal auto with Business use on it which will make your personal auto a little more expensive But it really depends on the type of business and the use . If you have your business name pained on your personal auto then this would not be a good fit for a personal auto policy . Each carrier has VERY specific guideline just like a pizza delivery driver needs a commercial auto policy most carriers on a personal auto would not cover you if you were doing that type of work and had personal auto coverage only .

{"input": "Who Is Covered By My Auto Insurance Policy? ", "output": "The easy answer for this would be `` Anyone you give permission to drive your vehicle . '' The exception to this would be anyone who is specifically excluded from your insurance policy . For example , a client of mine has a 17 year old son . Their son had a valid learners permit and went through the process of completing Drivers Ed , but never took the final exam and was never issued a license . Even though his permit has expired , based on his age and the fact that he had a permit , I recommended to my client they included him on their policy , but list him as an excluded driver . Because he is excluded , the insurance company does not rate him on the policy , and the premium did not increase . Outside of their son , anyone they give permission to drive their car would be covered , even if the person who borrowed the vehicle did not have their own insurance policy . You do run the risk of increased monthly premium payments should an uninsured driver borrow your car with your permission and be involved in an accident where they are liable however . So be careful of who and how often you do lend your vehicle out . "}
{"input": "Can You Lie About Smoking For Health Insurance? ", "output": "Well , of course you can , you can lie about virtually anything . The question should be is it ethical to lie about smoking for health insurance ? I suspect that in your heart you know the answer to that question is `` No . '' I presume you are asking this question in regard to the smoker 's penalty that can be applied to individual health insurance rates and that some employer 's utilize . At this time individual health plans are not requiring a screening test to determine if someone is a tobacco user and are relying on the honor system for applicants to self-report their usage . There are some employers that take a more strict approach to this matter and may screen you if they require a pre-employment physical . To be clear , if you are a tobacco user and you apply for health insurance asserting that you are not then you are engaging in fraud . Technically this could result in policy termination but my current understanding is that if the fraud is uncovered then the individual policyholder will be back billed at the tobacco user rate and expected to pay all the extra premium due . However , just because the Affordable Care Act allows for a tobacco use premium penalty does not mean that the health insurance carriers are compelled to apply it . So , you have some carriers that for administrative purposes at this time who are n't bothering with applying the tobacco use penalty and others who are . I would inquire with your insurance broker or the insurance carriers you are considering as to what their current rating approach is to tobacco use . In the employer setting the penalties could be more severe depending upon what their personnel policies are . Honesty is the best policy . "}

{"input": "What Are Medigap Excess Charges? ", "output": "There is much misinformation spread about this topic . The former answer at least implies that a doctor can just `` decide '' whether to accept Medicare assignment or not . It is important to understand that this is only true if a doctor has signed a non-participating agreement with Medicare . Most doctors -LRB- approx . 97 % -RRB- are contracted with Medicare as `` participating physicians '' , and as such must accept Medicare assignment , i.e. the Medicare approved amount for the service as payment in full . Participating physicians are not permitted to bill any Part B excess charges . Next , the former example given is simply incorrect : `` if you had an exam completed that they billed $ 500 for . Medicare says that a reasonable and customary charge is $ 400 . This means that Medicare will pay $ 400 for the exam that was completed . If the doctor accepts assignment , they take the $ 400 as payment in full . If they do not accept assignment , they can bill you up to 15 % of that $ 400 amount as an excess charge . In this example , the doctor could bill you for another $ 60 -LRB- $ 400 x 15 % = $ 60 -RRB- . '' The truth is that if the doctor is contracted as `` non-participating '' with Medicare and chooses not to accept assignment , they are first penalized 5 % of the Medicare approved amount -LRB- $ 400 x 5 % = $ 20 penalty -RRB- . Medicare will only reimburse $ 380 for this example -LRB- $ 400 - $ 20 penalty -RRB- . The doctor can bill you up to 15 % of the $ 380 as an excess charge in this example , or $ 57 . In not accepting assignment , the doctor may bill/collect $ 437 -LRB- $ 380 Medicare reimbursement + $ 57 excess charge -RRB- . This gives the doctor the opportunity to receive $ 437 instead of the $ 400 Medicare assignment , which in effect is a 9.25 % increase in revenue . Non-Participating physicians can decide whether to accept Medicare assignment on a case by case basis , and often do accept assignment , because if they do not , Medicare reimburses the claim to the beneficiary -LRB- consumer -RRB- , and the physician then must collect the reimbursement and the excess charge from the consumer in full . This adds administrative and collection costs that many non-Par physicians do not want to deal with . The former answer states that If you live in one of the states banning Part B excess charges , then the Medicare Part B excess charge benefit of Medigap plans F and G will not be major concern unless you move out of the state . But the truth is that Part B excess charges are not a concern , let alone a major concern , regardless of what state you are living in . For the reasons stated , Part B excess charges are rarely billed . Ask any Medicare beneficiary when was the last time they received a claim payment directly from Medicare -LRB- required if doctor was non-Par and refused assignment -RRB- . You will be hard pressed to find anyone answering yes . "}
{"input": "What Are Medigap Excess Charges? ", "output": "If you 're on original Medicare -LRB- Medicare Part A & Part B -RRB- , and go to a doctor and that doctor does not accept Medicare assignment -LRB- accepting the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full -RRB- , the doctor reserves the right to bill you an `` excess charge '' . An excess charge is an amount up to 15 % above and beyond the medicare-approved amount for the services provided by the doctor . For each type of service , examination , procedure , etc. , Medicare has an approved amount they deem as a reasonable and customary charge - this is known as the `` Medicare-approved amount '' . If the doctor accepts assignment , they are accepting the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full for services provided . If the doctor does not accept assignment , they can bill you an excess charge . For example , if you had an exam completed that they billed $ 500 for . Medicare says that a reasonable and customary charge is $ 400 . This means that Medicare will pay $ 400 for the exam that was completed . If the doctor accepts assignment , they take the $ 400 as payment in full . If they do not accept assignment , they can bill you up to 15 % of that $ 400 amount as an excess charge . In this example , the doctor could bill you for another $ 60 -LRB- $ 400 x 15 % = $ 60 -RRB- . If your Medigap plan covers excess charges , the Medigap insurance carrier will pay it for you . If the plan does not cover excess charges , you will be responsible for the payment of the excess charge . The two Medigap plans that cover excess charges are plans F and G. All of the other Medigap plans do not offer this benefit . So if you 'd like to have this benefit and do not already have a plan F or plan G , you may want to consider applying for one with a carrier . Remember , Medigap plans are standardized , so the only difference between insurance companies Medigap plans are the price they charge for it . Please note , certain states do not allow excess charges -LRB- due to the Medicare Overcharge Measure law -RRB- . The states that do not allow excess charges are Connecticut , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and Vermont . If you live in one of these states , then the Medicare Part B excess charge benefit of Medigap plans F and G will not be major concern unless you move out of the state . Please note , those living in these states may want to consider Medigap plans C and D for price comparison to Medigap plans F and G as they provide the exact same coverage , just without the excess charge benefit , and may provide you some savings on your premiums .

{"input": "Is Term Life Insurance Recommended? ", "output": "Term insurance , as stated before , is for a specific period of time that usually coincide with life events . For example , after the birth of a child , you will need enough coverage to provide for him/her if you died before he/she reached adulthood . That is usually 18 or so years . After that time , you would n't need to provide for that child in the same manner because the idea would be for the child -LRB- who is now an adult -RRB- to care for themself . As the other professionals have already stated , you would want to convert a term policy into a whole life policy prior to the end of the policy term if you have a continued need for life insurance . Converting your policy is better than purchasing a new one because policy approvals and premiums are based on current age , health status and other factors . When you are young and healthy , your premium payments are lower and it is easier to get approved . The older you are and the more health issues arise , the higher the premiums .

{"input": "How Much Would It Cost To Cash In 401K? ", "output": "Withdrawing money from a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- can be quite complicated and could be quite expensive . Since your employer has established the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- the plan documents that govern your plan are in his office . The first thing to find out is whether in service withdrawals are allowed by the plan . Often there will be allowed withdrawals but the withdrawal must meet certain conditions . It is important to determine if you have the right to withdraw money from the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- if you are still an employee . The rules also change if you leave your employer , whether voluntarily or involuntarily . You will probably find that your access to the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- is much greater if you have left your job . If your employer is contributing to your 401 -LRB- k -RRB- there is probably a vesting schedule that is a part of the plan documents . The vesting schedule tells you the percentage of the employers contribution that is actually yours . Normally these vesting schedules run out several years so money that is received by the account may not actually be yours for a number of years . Your deposits will remain yours . These are the employers contributions that have a vesting schedule . If the money in a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- has been deferred from current income tax you will be responsible to pay income tax as ordinary income in the year that you receive the money . If the money is in a Roth 401 -LRB- k -RRB- the withdrawal will be treated as a return of your contribution until you exhaust you basis -LRB- the total amount that you contributed . -RRB- The next major issue is your age . The rules vary a great deal if you are younger than fifty-nine and a half years old . If money can be withdrawn from a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and you are younger than fifty-nine and a half years old you will be subject . Generally speaking withdrawals from a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- prior to age fifty-nine and a half are also treated to a special penalty tax of ten per cent . This is changed in addition to the ordinary income tax on the distribution . You can not avoid paying income tax on the money received but there are ways to avoid paying the ten per cent penalty tax . There are several general reasons . The first reason is if the amount is being withdrawn because the participant has died . A beneficiary will receive all of the distributions of the inherited 401 -LRB- k -RRB- free of the penalty tax . This can become complicated if the beneficiary is a spouse , please see a retirement income adviser or competent tax advisor prior to finalizing a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- to a spouse . Another circumstance under which money can be taken from a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- without paying the penalty tax is if the money is need due to the disability of the participant . This can also be true if money is needed to pay deductible medial expense . There is also a method of withdrawing money that can avoid the penalty tax . This can be quite complicated but the gist is to take the money in substantially equal period payments . If you think about a retirement annuity you will understand this concept . The payments should be designed to cover the lifetime of the participant . It is necessary for the participant to leave employment to use this technique . The computations for these payments are complicated but there are advisors who can help you should this be necessary . It is important to note that the penalty tax is only applicable until you reach age fifty-nine and half and the payments under this plan do not need to be continued after that point . Other retirement programs have additional exceptions that are more liberal than a 401 -LRB- k. -RRB- IRAs , SEPs and SIMPLEs allow a $ 10,000 exemption to first-time homebuyers -LRB- this means anyone who is purchasing a home and hasnt owned a home for two years . -RRB- These plays also provide exceptions for higher education expenses -LRB- these must be taken in the year they are incurred , not the year that they are paid . -RRB- These plans offer exceptions for health insurance premiums for the unemployed .
